1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,639
We can see that the parasite organization
that Team Grey has been chasing

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,101
had used Saejin Church
as their base this whole time.

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,189
We raided the location based on a tip-off,
but it seems that they have all fled.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,860
However, we believe the leaders
may still be in Namil-gun.

5
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,653
{\an8}<i>Who gave the tip-off?</i>

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,198
Jeong Su-in, 29 years old.

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,326
{\an8}She is a clerk at a supermarket
near Namil-gun.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,494
"She <i>is</i>"?

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,497
She <i>was </i>a clerk!

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,625
Jeong Su-in is no longer a human.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,753
She's a parasite.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,048
I saw it myself and captured her alive.

13
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,174
That's not true.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,598
I am Kim Chul-min, Captain
of Violent Crimes Team 3 of Namil Police.

15
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,393
Ms. Jeong Su-in is a normal human being.

16
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,855
She's not a monster.
Tests have been conducted on her.

17
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,857
You tested her.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,859
Did you not?

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,821
Why aren't you reporting the test results?

20
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,031
Why?

21
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>What did the test results show?</i>

22
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,245
Oh, well, the thing is…

23
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,211
{\an8}We took head X-rays
and conducted a hair test.

24
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,629
{\an8}Based on the results,

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,008
{\an8}she doesn't exhibit any
of the characteristics seen in parasites.

26
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,390
How many times do I have to say
that I saw it myself?

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,393
That bitch is definitely a parasite.

28
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,231
We still don't know everything
about parasites.

29
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,818
Jeong Su-in might be
some kind of a mutant.

30
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,238
Our current methods
of distinguishing parasites

31
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,324
may not detect everything!

32
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,408
That's ridiculous.

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,119
You say you're unsure.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,789
And yet, you put that horrible machine
on a normal person

35
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,499
and torment her based on uncertainty?

36
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,251
What if something happens to her?

37
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:10,046
Who will take responsibility then?
Tell me. Do you not care?

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,632
-So, you decide who the monster is?
-Sir, come on.

39
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,884
Jeong Su-in is a human. A human!

40
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,139
-<i>Okay, please calm down.</i>
-Seriously.

41
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>So, what is</i>
<i>Jeong Su-in's current condition?</i>

42
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,396
She's currently in a coma.

43
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,899
She lost consciousness upon capture,
although there was no physical contact.

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,277
Her brain waves and pulse are very slow.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,071
She's in a coma,
but things could change at any moment,

46
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,198
so she's being held under tight security.

47
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>All right. Let's do this.</i>

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,038
<i>We believe it's time to inform the public</i>

49
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>about the existence of these parasites.</i>

50
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>In order to prevent further social chaos</i>
<i>due to the spread of made-up stories</i>

51
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>or unchecked information on the internet,</i>

52
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>we must give the public</i>
<i>a clear picture of these parasites</i>

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,302
<i>and reassure them.</i>

54
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,345
<i>In order to achieve this,</i>

55
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,974
<i>Team Grey needs to have</i>
<i>a clear understanding of the parasites</i>

56
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>as well as the ability to contain them.</i>

57
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,854
<i>Do you understand?</i>

58
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,399
<i>First, please transfer Jeong Su-in,</i>
<i>that human, parasite,</i>

59
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,735
<i>or whatever she is, to the headquarters.</i>

60
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>We'll conduct a more thorough study.</i>

61
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>The transfer operation will be led</i>
<i>by Captain Choi Jun-kyung.</i>

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,913
<i>And I ask the officers of Namil-gun</i>
<i>to work with Team Grey</i>

63
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,874
<i>and put your best efforts</i>
<i>into eradicating the parasites.</i>

64
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>This is a critical public safety matter.</i>

65
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,841
{\an8}<i>We will send two police tactical units</i>
<i>from the nearest region as support.</i>

66
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,428
<i>Please make the transfer</i>
<i>as soon as you are ready.</i>

67
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,305
<i>Am I clear, Captain Choi?</i>

68
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
Yes, sir. Understood.

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,103
<i>That'll be all.</i>

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,814
Thank you, sir.

71
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,666
He called it "a thorough study,"

72
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
but they'll cut open her head
and dissect her at the headquarters.

73
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,170
What if she dies?

74
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,715
If she does…
she doesn't have any family, right?

75
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,552
My God, poor thing.

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,723
My goodness, that poor thing.

77
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,741
Anything unusual?

78
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,618
No, there's nothing unusual.

79
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,371
Her brain waves and pulse are both normal.

80
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,207
I'll watch her.
You should take a quick break.

81
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,376
Oh? Would that be okay?

82
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,380
Thank you. I'll be right back.

83
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,409
PARASYTE: THE GREY

84
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,888
What is this place?

85
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,060
This is not reality.

86
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,980
Who are you?

87
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,110
I am the parasite inside of you.

88
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,362
You two call me Heidi.

89
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,489
What?

90
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,409
In real life,
you are in a very dangerous situation.

91
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,744
If you were conscious,

92
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,123
you would have a panic attack,
suffer excruciating pain,

93
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
and probably die soon.

94
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,921
So I cut off your consciousness
from the outside world.

95
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
What? Then where am I…?

96
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,594
We are deep within your mind.

97
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,347
In your inner thoughts.

98
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,406
This may be our first and only chance
to speak face-to-face,

99
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,369
so I brought you to the place
that contains the truth about you.

100
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,954
You're not me.

101
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,540
Don't pretend to be me with my face.

102
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,585
In the end,
you and I have no choice but to coexist.

103
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,213
So I thought it'd be best
to talk to you with this face.

104
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,966
If it makes you uncomfortable,
what about this?

105
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,263
Should we report this?

106
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,766
I don't think
we need to report every little thing.

107
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,018
She must be dreaming.

108
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,728
Right?

109
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,898

<i>handling the operation,</i>

111
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,529
-Captain.
-Yeah?

112
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,158
We identified the man we suspect
was with Jeong Su-in last night.

113
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,242
-Really?
-Yes.

114
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,369
Okay. I'll be right in.

115
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,787
I'll see you inside, sir.

116
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,416
<i>The traffic control dispatch schedule</i>
<i>has been updated.</i>

117
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,752
<i>Please check the latest communications.</i>

118
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,846
I have no reason to harm you,
so do not be afraid.

119
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,108
Do you recognize this place?

120
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,362
Of course I do.

121
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,864
It's my house.

122
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,078
That's my dad.

123
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,874
This is the day
I reported my dad to the police.

124
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,548
After my mom left us,
he started to take his anger out on me.

125
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,634
I was beaten every day.

126
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,011
Over and over.

127
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,432
Then I reported him.

128
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,602
Because I wanted to live.

129
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,023
This was the day I mustered up the courage

130
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,277
so I could live.

131
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,698
But…

132
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,201
people looked at me as if I was a monster.

133
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,831
They couldn't believe
a small child reported her dad.

134
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,750
That's why I was a monster to them.

135
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,302
Captain.

136
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,765
His name is Seol Kang-woo.
He has two priors for violent crimes.

137
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,976
The Guro Police Station sent this over.

138
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,605
He's a henchman for the Mangnani,
a gang active in the Guro area.

139
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,817
We identified a few gangbangers from Guro
among the bodies found at Saejin Church.

140
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,777
They might be connected to him.

141
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,322
Oh, and according to a detective in Guro,

142
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,907
there was a power struggle
between the Mangnani in Guro

143
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,868
and the Cheoli in Yeongdeungpo.

144
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,162
The Mangnani, Seol Kang-woo's gang,

145
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,831
tried in vain
to kill the Cheoli underboss.

146
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,168
After that, he must've returned
to his hometown, Namil-gun.

147
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,130
He's caused some trouble in the area
over the last few days.

148
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,300
It seems he was made a scapegoat
for peace between the two gangs.

149
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,346
He was such a small fry,
his gang used him and dumped him.

150
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,347
Fucking idiot.

151
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,976
Sir, two taxis drove away
from Changseong Theme Park yesterday.

152
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,812
One went to Cheonggun Apartments,

153
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,398
and the other to the motel district
near Namil Terminal.

154
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,152
The terminal? Wow, such an obvious move.
That bastard should've tried harder.

155
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,571
He might have run off
to another region by now.

156
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,658
-Should we send guys to the terminal?
-No. I'll go.

157
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,743
What?

158
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,205
By the way,
Team Grey is gonna transfer Su-in today.

159
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,207
Assist them if asked.

160
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,709
-Understood, sir.
-Oh, the handcuffs.

161
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,669
-Okay.
-Hurry.

162
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,003
-Here, sir.
-Thanks.

163
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,215
-Will you be okay by yourself?
-Don't mention this to Team Grey.

164
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,508
-Yes, sir.
-Got it, sir.

{\an8}A WASTE-FREE, ECO-FRIENDLY FESTIVAL

173
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,375
{\an8}CHOI YONG-JAE MEMORIAL FESTIVAL

174
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,129
This is why I don't watch the news. Shit!

175
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,809
Hello. May I check your ticket, please?

176
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,587
Don't you think
your moves are too obvious?

177
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,884
Do not move. Stay still.

178
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,095
All right.

179
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,389
Let's not make a scene.

180
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,980
Relax your arm, asshole.

181
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,403
Damn it.

182
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,492
You can't just arrest me
without following proper procedure.

183
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,076
What about the "the Fifth" thing?

184
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,498
Do you even know what that means?

185
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,835
It means you should keep
that fucking mouth shut, you idiot.

186
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,003
Fine, I'll go.

187
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,423
But not to your station.
A different one, far from here.

188
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,176
What bullshit are you saying now?

189
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,930
There's a monster at your station.
A monster.

190
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,557
-He's disguising himself as a cop.
-What?

191
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,727
Remember the monster in the iron mask
at the theme park?

192
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312
One of your cops killed him.

193
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,857
It was a monster
wearing that iron mask, right?

194
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,236
We've already undergone tests.

195
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,447
Save the bullshit, you asshole.

196
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,867
I guess your fucking tests
don't work. Do they?

197
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,953
Remember the guy in the raincoat?

198
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,831
I clearly saw that bastard
stabbing the monster.

199
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,874
-Oh, did you really?
-I'm telling you I did.

200
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,170
Okay. What does he look like? Tell me.

201
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,923
Here, take a look.

202
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,843
So, is he here?

203
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,262
Which one? Tell me.

204
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,808
Fuck, it's this one.
This bastard is the monster.

205
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,602
Wow. It's pretending to be human.
Crazy bastard.

206
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,897
Holy fuck. It really looks like a human.

207
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
Listen carefully.

208
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,868
Tell me everything
that's happened to you and Su-in.

209
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
Don't leave a single detail out.

210
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,580
Got it?

211
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,175
Route 39, right? Got it. Thank you.

212
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
Oh, don't mention it, sir.

213
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,679
Don't go out on a limb. Just stay safe.

214
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,557
When orders are given, I just follow.
I'll get going, sir.

215
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,642
Let's grab a meal sometime, okay?

216
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,185
-Special forces!
-Special forces.

217
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,701
When will they transfer her?

218
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,288
The transfer will be made
in two hours via Route 39.

219
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,623
Understood.

220
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to.</i>

221
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,252
How come unexpected incidents
keep happening?

222
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,089
We're still moving forward
with our plan, right?

223
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,674
Yes.

224
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,843
It starts today.

225
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,705
<i>I begged Mr. Chul-min</i>

226
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,874
<i>to be able to see my mom just once,</i>

227
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,085
<i>so he found her address for me.</i>

228
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,921
<i>I was curious.</i>

229
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,174
<i>"Wouldn't Mom miss me?"</i>

230
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,139
<i>"I'm her child, so maybe she missed me."</i>

231
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,269
She showed so much love
to the other child she gave birth to

232
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,604
while living happily with another man.

233
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,483
<i>But she looked at me</i>

234
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>as if I were some kind of bug.</i>

235
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,117
<i>How could she be like that?</i>

236
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,747
<i>I was her child too, so why?</i>

237
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,709
How could she look at me
with such disgust?

238
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
That's when I realized…

239
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,800
that I'm just a horrible human being.

240
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,430
<i>Someone who can't be loved by anyone.</i>

241
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,939
You can never come here again.

242
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,008
Humans do not judge any object
as an independent entity.

243
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,555
Your mother is judging you
in relation to the environment

244
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,183
in which her husband abused her.

245
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,687
Rather than disliking you
as an individual entity,

246
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,316
her experience in that environment,
which you were also a part of,

247
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,945
makes her believe she dislikes you.

248
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,116
It's not that you were cursed
in particular.

249
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,450
Shut up.

250
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,246
It's just like how a thing like you
invaded my body.

251
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,124
It's because I'm such an unlucky bitch

252
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,417
that a monster like you crawled into me.

253
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,587
Once again,
I was not born out of my own will.

254
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,882
Had you and I not integrated together,

255
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,592
we both would have died.

256
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,594
You should have just let me die!

257
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,514
Why did you have to turn me
into a monster?

258
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,494
So what you're saying is

259
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,331
that Su-in has been infected
by a parasite.

260
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,374
Yes.

261
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,127
But Su-in's… How should I put this?

262
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,628
Her humanity remains intact.

263
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,880
-Is that it?
-God.

264
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,465
It's not that her humanity remains.

265
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,551
Jeong Su-in is still all there.

266
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,803
She's the main being, but sometimes…

267
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,390
Okay? Just sometimes, it pops out.
And we call it Heidi.

268
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,433
Heidi pops out.

269
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,144
And what's Heidi's goal?

270
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,188
To protect Jeong Su-in.

271
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,273
Why? So it can survive too.

272
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,403
-Let's talk more at the station.
-Oh, come on.

273
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,699
I'm telling you,
there's a monster cop at your station.

274
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,409
I'll be dead. That's murder.

275
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,433
What now?

276
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,778
Su-in will be transferred
to the headquarters today.

277
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,571
But she'll die if she goes there.

278
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
Like you said,
if her consciousness is there,

279
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,243
that means she is human.

280
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,662
Then I can't send her there.

281
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,580
Okay. And?

282
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,415
Hey.

283
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
Help me out.

284
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,588
I'm getting her out
before she gets transferred.

285
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,550
-How?
-Listen carefully.

286
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,137
If you get Su-in out,
I'll protect both of you.

287
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,723
Okay? Trust me on this.

288
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,476
I'm gonna make a deal with Team Grey.

289
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,605
As I see it, Team Grey doesn't know
much about the parasites either.

290
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,733
And the Hunting Dog they used is now dead.

291
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,068
You said you saw it happen.

292
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,737
So the information you two have

293
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,699
is something
that Team Grey needs critically.

294
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,243
I'll make a deal with them
using that as leverage.

295
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,996
But what if they don't believe
what we say?

296
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,789
Look, what's their goal?

297
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,417
Their only goal is
to get rid of those monsters.

298
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,003
I'll tell them you'll both cooperate,
and you will.

299
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,631
Saejin Church and its parasites
will be eradicated.

300
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,091
Problem solved!

301
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
I'm telling you. I'll protect you!

302
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,054
Okay, fine.

303
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,142
If things go wrong,
I'll get you to a safe place,

304
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,352
even if that means
smuggling you out, okay?

305
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,109
I have a choice here, right?

306
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,612
Yes.

307
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,281
Make your choice.

308
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,327
Run away now or help me out this once.

309
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,460
Hey, you punk!

310
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,339
Do you know why you got betrayed
by your gang and are on the run now?

311
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,216
Because you're a goddamn coward.

312
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,760
Right?

313
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,055
You said the monsters killed
your younger sister,

314
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,099
and your older sister became one, right?

315
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,519
Now Su-in,
who saved your life, is about to die.

316
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,897
And you're running away?

317
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,067
Well, that's who you are,
a goddamn coward.

318
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,446
You're the kind of bastard
who betrays those who trust you--

319
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,405
No.

320
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,990
It's not "betray."

321
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,285
You just don't have the guts
to trust anyone.

322
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,872
That's why you're always thinking about
how to run away.

323
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,833
The Mangnani Gang knew that about you.

324
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,795
That's why you're disposable,
you pathetic bastard.

325
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,463
That's right.

326
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,508
Fine. Go, then. Go.

327
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,762
I don't intend to work
with a coward like you to rescue Su-in.

328
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,642
There's no point in trying to give punks
a chance for a fresh start.

329
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,186
Go.

330
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,522
Beat it, you asshole!

331
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,943
If I ever catch you again,
I'll rip you apart, okay?

332
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,071
That asshole punk.

333
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,865
Fucking dickhole.

334
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,954
Fuck this shit!

335
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,376
Damn it.

336
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,212
You have a way with words.

337
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,006
You'd make a great home-shopping host
or politician.

338
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,217
Don't try to be funny when you're not.

339
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,719
You're bearable at least
with your fucking mouth shut.

340
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,055
Okay, then. What's next?

341
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,145
{\an8}NAMIL POLICE STATION

342
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>Listen carefully.</i>
<i>I'll give you an access card.</i>

343
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,317
<i>Go up to the second floor with that.</i>

344
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,402
RESTRICTED AREA

345
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,073
Put this on.

346
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,742
At the end of the second-floor hallway,

347
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,036
there is a temporary locker room
for Team Grey.

348
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,123
It'll be time for a shift change
by the time we get there.

349
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,541
Go into that locker room,

350
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,252
subdue the guard,
and go in the container instead of him.

351
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,962
What if they recognize me?

352
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,466
<i>The task force was formed</i>
<i>less than a month ago.</i>

353
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,384
<i>They don't know each other that well.</i>

354
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,555
<i>All you have to do is go in</i>
<i>and act as naturally as you can. Okay?</i>

355
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,600
LOCKER ROOM

356
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,818
You can subdue one guy, can't you?

357
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,821
I'm not a fucking weakling.
Of course I can subdue a cop.

358
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,119
Special forces.

359
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,080
Who the hell are you?

360
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,249
I was a marine.

361
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,587
Hey! Who the hell are you?

362
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
How did you get in here?

363
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,512
Hey, I said who the hell are you?

364
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,770
You little…

365
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,399
Hey. Take this with you.

366
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,736
-What is this?
-It's pepper spray.

367
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,821
Oh, come on.

368
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,990
You keep it. Put it away. God.

369
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,368
You've got to be kidding me.

370
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,828
Take it.

371
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,039
Damn it.

372
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,425
Hey, do you have a size in large?

373
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,741
<i>ETD in one hour, confirmed.</i>

374
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey.

375
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,925
God, that freaking bastard.

376
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,392
<i>Once inside the container,</i>

377
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,438
<i>find the remote control to disengage</i>
<i>the machine over Su-in's head.</i>

378
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,355
You're late.

379
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,234
There's nothing special to note.
Just stand by until departure.

380
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,778
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

381
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,370
Wait.

382
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,627
Did you eat dinner?

383
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,629
What did they serve?

384
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,926
Oh, I guess it was good.

385
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,012
So, what was it?

386
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,478
Hey, which base are you from?

387
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,573
Anyway, dinner was good, right?

388
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,035
Okay, thank you.

389
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,754
Okay, we're going to take off
earlier than planned,

390
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,297
so get ready, everyone.

391
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,350
I'll take the remote control myself.

392
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,733
One of you should stay with her
and monitor her condition.

393
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,153
Get inside the container
and travel with her. Understood?

394
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,157
Now, let's hurry up and get ready.

395
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,413
What's up? Did you not hear her?
Get in. Hurry up.

396
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,581
Over here.

397
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,760
Okay, move quickly.

398
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,886
Come on.

399
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,389
Get ready quickly.

400
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,435
Oh fuck.

401
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,894
Damn it.

402
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,105
Stop!

403
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:53,940
Move quickly.

404
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,192
Yes, it's all good.

405
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,361
Further back.

406
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,164
<i>All troops, board the vehicles.</i>
<i>Check the radio and stand by.</i>

407
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,422
Damn it.
I shouldn't have trusted that punk.

408
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,507
Hey, wait.

409
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,634
-I knew it.
-What are you doing?

410
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:26,389
I knew you'd do this, so I informed
the chief that we'll provide support too.

411
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,767
We should at least let him know.
I did well, right?

412
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
Right. Well done.

413
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,109
Let's go.

414
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,710
Su-in.

415
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,505
Heidi, can you at least wake up?

416
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,479
My goodness, everyone is working so hard.

417
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,576
Damn, this much manpower
just to transfer one kid.

418
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,286
This seems like overkill.

419
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,371
Don't you agree?

420
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,293
Why are you so tense?

421
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:39,879
Me?

422
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,468
Like you said, we don't know
what'll happen to her once transferred.

423
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,136
That's why.

424
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,933
By the way,

425
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,143
you said you go to church.

426
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,105
What church?

427
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,069
Why ask all of a sudden?

428
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,737
What?

429
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,490
Because it's hilarious, you idiot.

430
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,994
It's not like you're gonna come with me.

431
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,663
Yeah, you're right.

432
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,470
Escort vehicle, how's the situation ahead?

433
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,264
<i>Traffic is congested</i>
<i>from 100 meters ahead.</i>

434
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,726
Check what's going on but stay vigilant.

435
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,062
<i>Copy. Two men are moving to the front.</i>

436
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,279
Why'd we stop?

437
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,118
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

438
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,287
-Are they special forces?
-What is it?

439
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,247
Has there been an accident?

440
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,124
-What's this?
-What's going on?

441
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,091
<i>Arrived at the scene.</i>

442
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,008
What is this?

443
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,761
-There's been an accident.
-What's with him?

444
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,932
Looks like there's been an accident.

445
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,692
<i>Emergency!</i>

446
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>Man down! Requesting support!</i>

447
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,331
<i>We have an injured man!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

448
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,791
They want the Hunting Dog.

449
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,292
Turn around and leave.

450
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,962
<i>Multiple targets identified.</i>
<i>They're among the civilians!</i>

451
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,474
<i>There are too many citizens</i>
<i>to identify parasites.</i>

452
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,227
Evacuate!

453
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,311
-Move to the back!
-Go!

454
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,188
Move back! Evacuate!

455
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,189
Damn it.

456
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,025
Evacuate now!

457
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,319
Evacuate now!

458
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,881
Hey, we have to evacuate people.

459
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,801
<i>Multiple parasites identified!</i>
<i>Requesting support!</i>

460
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,767
What's going on?

461
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,228
Hey, evacuate the people first.
Goddamn it.

462
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,521
Please get out of the car!

463
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,273
Come on out!

464
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,150
Get out of the car! Hurry!

465
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,069
Move toward the back! Quickly!

466
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,404
Don't stay in the car! Hurry!

467
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:14,987
<i>Agent, do you copy?</i>

468
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,031
<i>Report the situation! Vehicle hit!</i>

469
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,305
Damn it!

470
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,112
Hey, are you okay?

471
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:57,947
Jeong Su-in.

472
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,490
Heidi!

473
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,704
Who the hell are you, you bastard?

474
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,601
Captain!

475
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,443
Damn it!

476
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,092
There have always been people
trying to help you<i>,</i>

477
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,678
even when you consider yourself a monster.

478
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,934
Just by acknowledging

479
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,522
that there are people
who think of them and care for them,

480
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,108
humans can never be alone.

481
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,028
You did a good job.

482
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,447
You're so brave, Su-in.

483
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,658
You saved yourself, didn't you?

484
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,256
Hey, let's go home.

485
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,467
What do I press? This?

486
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:05,968
Fuck.

487
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,056
Damn it, whatever.

488
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,228
Oh! It worked!

489
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,231
It's time to go back.

490
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,160
Hey.

491
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,043
What?

492
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,920
No time for that. We gotta go.

493
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,254
Get up.

494
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,182
Hey, stop right there.

495
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,184
Wait. Hold.

496
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,686
-Sir, I need to check your car.
-What?

497
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,855
A vehicle has been stolen, you see.

498
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,649
Please step out of the car.

499
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,114
Damn it.

500
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,498
Stop!

501
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,792
Stop!

502
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,716
Captain! Get in quickly! Come on!

503
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,051
Quickly!

504
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,359
-That fucking monster was shooting at us.
-Monster?

505
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,486
What's going on?

506
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,780
What about Mr. Chul-min? Why was he there?

507
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,493
Oh, that. He and I came up with a plan
to get you out of there.

508
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,662
And we are about to succeed.

509
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,040
You mentioned a monster.
Who are you talking about?

510
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,961
The bastard next to your cop friend.
He's a monster.

511
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,214
I saw him killing the monster
in the iron mask.

512
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,091
I've explained this so many times.

513
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:33,949
What the hell?

514
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,784
What are you doing?

515
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,213
What? Did they give up?

516
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,089
Your cop friend must've done something.

517
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,761
There's another monster there.

518
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,721
-What?
-He's in danger. Pull over!

519
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,973
-Are you crazy?
-I said pull over!

520
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,316
Hey!

521
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,528
Shit.

522
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,198
Hey! I did all I could!

523
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,242
Whatever. Fuck it.

524
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,005
What are you doing?

525
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,843
Captain, let's stop this now.

526
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,691
Hey, what the hell are you doing,
you bastard?

527
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,237
Captain.

528
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,702
As the police,
we chase criminals day in and day out,

529
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,371
pulling all-nighters, but what do we gain?

530
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,289
Tell me.

531
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,959
We get cursed at, beaten, and stabbed.

532
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,796
And despite our performance,
our fucking salary barely goes up.

533
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:15,217
We live a pathetic life,
barely able to afford our kids' tuition.

534
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,970
Are you out of your fucking mind?

535
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,017
"If I'd known this from the start,
I would've chosen a different path."

536
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,019
You always say that, right?

537
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,606
Well, if an opportunity comes your way,

538
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,816
seize it.

539
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,862
Are you still the Won-seok I know?

540
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,949
You asked me what church I go to.

541
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,787
I go to Saejin Church.

542
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,467
Captain, put your gun away
and hear me out.

543
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,053
Our Saejin Church

544
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,013
is different.

545
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,349
How should I put it?

546
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,144
They're much more rational.

547
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,731
They have a clear understanding
of our society. Very objective too.

548
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,317
They aren't irrational like humans.

549
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,319
You see, Captain,

550
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,239
I seized the opportunity
I'd been waiting for

551
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,076
my entire life.

552
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,122
You shouldn't miss out either, okay?

553
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,040
Captain.

554
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,127
Please trust me just this once.

555
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,630
I don't want to kill you.

556
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,632
Please trust me.

557
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,426
Is that why you killed the Hunting Dog?

558
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,907
Jeong Su-in!

559
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,325
Get in quickly!

560
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,131
Aren't we going after them?

561
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,176
Seeing it running away like this,

562
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,637
it is a rational being
that puts survival first.

563
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,098
It will not be much of a threat.

564
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,438
Besides, I need to get used to this body.

565
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,991
It doesn't seem like
there are any more parasites here.

566
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,953
Assess any casualties
and call the forensics.

567
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,297
Jeong Su-in, are you okay?

568
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,508
I guess you're Heidi.

569
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,802
How's Su-in doing right now?

570
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,305
Su-in needs time right now.

571
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,352
A lot of time.

572
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,455
Get changed. You have blood on you.

573
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,485
