1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,222
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT

2
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,190
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION SHRANK
TO A HUNDREDTH OF ITS SIZE

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,818
WOULD THE POISON SPEWED
ALSO DECREASE BY THE SAME AMOUNT?

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,789
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION WAS CUT IN HALF

5
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,375
HOW MANY MORE FORESTS WOULD SURVIVE?

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,383
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,969
WE MUST PROTECT
THE FUTURE OF ALL LIVING THINGS

8
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,391
What did you say, you motherfucker?

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,601
Fuck. What bullshit!

10
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,062
Motherfuckers, you don't think
I can kill someone?

11
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,521
ENOUGH, OR YOU'LL MAKE HIM CRY

12
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,439
THEN KILL SOMEONE

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,356
Fuck.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,566
HE HAS AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX

15
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,152
Try me.

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,781
These fucking bastards.

17
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,817
Jesus.

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,863
Wake up. Why did you even come
if you were just going to sleep?

19
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,115
Come out and dance a little, okay?

20
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,868
Come on, get up!

21
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,495
Jeez, you're so lame.

22
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,164
Whatever. Just sleep.

23
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,499
Oh, hey.

24
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,502
Hey! Did you sober up a bit? Yes?

25
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,705
PARASYTE: THE GREY

26
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,041
ONE HOUR AGO

27
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,961
What?

28
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,921
It's not working again.

29
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,631
One moment, please.

30
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,186
Sir, it's not working again.

31
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,812
God, this is driving me nuts.

32
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:56,981
Do you need a bag?

33
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,153
Do you have a rewards card?
If not, that'll be 44,990 won.

34
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,704
Sir, you need to get a price tag
for the meat at the meat counter.

35
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,707
Sir.

36
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,501
Sir!

37
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,134
You need to get a price tag for this
at the meat counter.

38
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,637
This is how they gave it to me.

39
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,390
Please get a price tag
at the meat counter.

40
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,058
Not my problem.

41
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,894
You can just get it yourselves, damn it.

42
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,688
Well, the meat counter handles the meat.

43
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,109
-Please go over there--
-Fuck! I said you go get it!

44
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,696
Why the hell are you motherfuckers
ordering a customer around?

45
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,459
Fuck. This is bullshit, seriously.

46
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,169
Should I just kill you all?

47
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,464
Fuck. I swear I'll just kill them all.

48
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,428
Next in line.

49
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,734
I'm heading out first.

50
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,279
Okay. Good night, Su-in.
Thanks for your hard work.

51
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,280
Thank you.

52
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,242
Hey, good work today.

53
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,572
Hey, you bitch.

54
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,908
What did you say to me earlier?

55
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,993
Say it again, you little bitch!

56
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,287
Come here, damn it!

57
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,254
Fuck! You fucking bitch!

58
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,134
Listen, you motherfuckers!

59
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,972
Do you really think I can't kill anyone?
You hear me?

60
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,891
That bitch. I will kill you.

61
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,893
Fuck. I'm going to kill you.

62
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,522
Shit!

63
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,526
Hey, you think I won't kill you
if you hide?

64
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,237
Just wait, you little bitch.

65
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,740
Fuck.

66
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,976
Hello?

67
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm near the intersection
by the Namcheon power plant.

68
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,647
I think there's been an accident here.

69
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,150
I see a motorcycle knocked over.
Yes, and a car.

70
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,617
Yes, I'll brief you first thing tomorrow.

71
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,035
Yes, understood, sir.

72
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,078
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

73
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,456
Jesus, I'm so sick of this.

74
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,874
Jeez. Seriously.

75
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,043
This is the third violent crime
of the day.

76
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
When it rains, it pours. Where's Won-seok?

77
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,921
Detective Kang will be here soon too.

78
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,383
I mean, why is he always late
when something happens?

79
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,718
So, who's the suspect?

80
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,136
His name is Lee Kyung-chun.

81
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,597
He is 43 years old
with two priors for violent crimes

82
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,182
and a history of schizophrenia.

83
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,851
-Schizophrenia?
-Yes.

84
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,064
It seems he had a minor dispute
with the victim at the supermarket.

85
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,775
We've secured testimonies
from the other employees.

86
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,860
He followed the victim in his car,

87
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,404
then hit her
and threatened her with a weapon.

88
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,864
Crazy bastard. And?

89
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,284
And?

90
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
The thing is…

91
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,995
Well,

92
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,291
he was following the victim with a weapon,
and then he died on the spot.

93
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,585
-From excessive bleeding.
-Who?

94
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,420
The suspect?

95
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,215
Yes, it seems that he was cut
with something sharp

96
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,966
from his chest to his face.

97
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,760
You said he followed her and hit her.

98
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,805
-So, what are you talking about?
-Well, it's unclear.

99
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,182
Whether he got injured
when he hit the motorcycle

100
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,226
or got caught on something and was cut.

101
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,561
I think we need an autopsy.

102
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,605
What a bunch of nonsense. Forget it.

103
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,775
-And the victim?
-Yes.

104
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,611
The victim's name is Jeong Su-in.
She's 29.

105
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,742
Do you happen to know her?

106
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,749
Yeah.

107
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,464
<i>How is she?</i>

108
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,591
<i>She's unconscious.</i>

109
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,260
But they say she's fine.

110
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,639
You said she got hit by a car,
so how can she be fine?

111
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
This part is strange too.

112
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:10,104
There are scars on the victim's back
as though she had been stabbed.

113
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,733
Her clothes were also
heavily stained with her own blood.

114
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,652
But they said
these scars aren't from today.

115
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,304
You can never come here again.

116
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,318
Excuse me. What happened?

117
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,611
Are you feeling better?

118
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,783
Mr. Chul-min.

119
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,992
Su-in.

120
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,536
Are you okay?

121
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,165
Why am I here?

122
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,708
Do you remember anything

123
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,336
about your sudden attack today?

124
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,839
Yes, it was the man from the supermarket.

125
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,174
Yes, that man. Right.

126
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,135
That's why I'm here right now.
Are you really okay?

127
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,181
We had a little argument
at the supermarket,

128
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,724
and he must have followed me.

129
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,269
He ran into me with his car,
and with his knife…

130
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,649
He did stab me with his knife…

131
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,068
Thankfully, they say you're not hurt.

132
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,486
What?

133
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,738
But I was stabbed.

134
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,491
They said those scars seem to be very old.

135
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,160
Scars? I don't have any scars.

136
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,496
What about your attacker?

137
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,748
Was he badly injured during the incident?

138
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,708
Not at all.

139
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,212
He came after me with a knife,

140
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,465
and I was bleeding so much.

141
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,218
I can't really remember…

142
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,763
Did you catch the guy?

143
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,932
He died at the scene.

144
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,435
-He was cut from his chest to his face.
-Hey, hold on.

145
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,146
I'll discuss that with her.
You guys wait outside.

146
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,773
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

147
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,275
Yeah, wait outside.

148
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,869
I don't understand.

149
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,871
That man stabbed me with a knife

150
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,915
and followed me,
but he just suddenly died?

151
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,169
When you suddenly go through
a traumatic event,

152
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,423
your thoughts can get mixed up
and distorted.

153
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,426
You don't need to try hard
to remember things right now, okay?

154
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,927
But

155
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm positive I was stabbed.

156
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,892
Why?

157
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,269
What makes you so sure?

158
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,814
As I was being stabbed, I was thinking,

159
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,358
"Here we go again."

160
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,071
-"Here we go again"?
-Yes.

161
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,657
Yet again, I am dogged by misfortune.

162
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,912
There's this feeling I'm used to.

163
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,041
"It seems my misfortune has returned."

164
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,587
Su-in, nothing like that
will happen again.

165
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,798
I had the same feeling when I was ten
and my dad was abusing me.

166
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,551
When my dad threw a fit
while holding an iron,

167
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,012
or beat me and broke my bones,

168
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,140
I had the same thought.

169
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,936
"It seems my misfortune has returned."

170
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,439
The moment I got stabbed,

171
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,401
that thought suddenly came
into my mind again.

172
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,366
No, nothing like that
will ever happen again. Okay?

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,535
If you hadn't saved me from my father,

174
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,287
I wouldn't even be alive.

175
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,749
You're the one who called the police.

176
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,713
You think it's easy for a ten-year-old kid
to report her own father to the police?

177
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,633
I wasn't the one who saved you.

178
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,219
You saved yourself.

179
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,555
And

180
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,559
you'll still be the only one
who can save yourself going forward.

181
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
That's how it is.

182
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,319
Just let me know what happened today
when you remember.

183
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,406
Hey, I'm so relieved
that you're all right.

184
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:31,991
Got it?

185
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,786
Call me right away if you need anything
or something comes to mind.

186
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,957
Get some rest.

187
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,599
Captain.

188
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,060
Gosh, I'm sorry I'm late.

189
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,603
You sure took your time.

190
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,147
Were you at the church service?

191
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,149
Won-seok, praying doesn't suit you.

192
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,233
Shut up.

193
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,317
You go to church?

194
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,820
Forget it. Just go home.

195
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,405
You've interviewed the victim?

196
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,782
-I wanted to meet her too.
-Let's take a breather.

197
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,242
Come in at the crack of dawn.

198
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,243
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,996
If we solve a few of the cases
that happened today,

200
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,874
we'll be shot up
the promotion ladder, right?

201
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,771
A FEW MONTHS LATER

202
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,074
Good evening, boss.

203
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,158
-Sir.
-Sir.

204
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,668
Has the Mangnani Gang
made any kind of move?

205
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,961
No, they're quiet, sir.

206
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,007
They can't do a damn thing
even though we took over their business.

207
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,635
-They're just small fry.
-Okay, good work.

208
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,969
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

209
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,694
He went into room number eight.

210
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,429
You bastard.

211
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,949
Hey, is anyone out there?

212
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,787
That bastard. Go get that bastard.

213
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,789
-Come here!
-You motherfucker!

214
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,624
-Come here!
-Stop, you fucker!

215
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,376
-Go get him!
-Stop right there!

216
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,605
We've arrived. Off the bus, please.

217
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,709

What is it? You scared me.

227
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,118
Has it been so long
you forgot your little brother's face?

228
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,496
Don't worry. I won't stay for too long.

229
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,042
Well, Jin-hee said
that you have a brain tumor.

230
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,210
But you look fine.

231
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,046
Is Jin-hee sleeping?

232
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,757
She went somewhere far away.

233
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,136
Far away, where?

234
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,846
I don't know either.

235
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,895
What the heck is she wearing?

236
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,223
No matter what,
she never leaves the store unattended.

237
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,725
But she went somewhere far?

238
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,602
And you don't even know?

239
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,648
"Ki-seok"?

240
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,570
<i>Outgoing calls</i>

SAEJIN CHURCH
REVIVAL PRAYER MEETING

243
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,330
MR. CHUL-MIN

244
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,999
Hello, Mr. Chul-min.

245
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,418
<i>Hey. Is everything okay?</i>

246
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,171
Yes, nothing unusual.
I've just been going to work.

247
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,758
<i>Still, take it easy.</i>
<i>You need to take care of yourself.</i>

248
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,343
<i>How about going on a vacation?</i>

249
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,012
Well, they said I'm fine.

250
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,266
There isn't even anywhere I'd want to go.

251
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,225
<i>Really?</i>

252
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,478
<i>But still, don't push yourself</i>
<i>too hard, okay?</i>

253
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,439
Okay, I got it.

254
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,025
Thank you, Mr. Chul-min.

255
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,945
<i>Jeez, no reason to thank me. Bye, then.</i>

256
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:12,659
<i>This stop is Gyeongjin Market.</i>
<i>The next stop is…</i>

257
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,862
Please open the back door.

258
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,400
I said I'd get us a hotel room nearby.

259
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,028
I prefer my place.

260
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,365
I know. I prefer your place too, honey.

261
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,825
But don't women usually prefer
going to hotels?

262
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,329
No. I prefer my place.

263
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,289
-I really do.
-Okay.

264
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,751
I love women like you.
Women who cut to the chase.

265
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,420
But you talk down to me a bit.

266
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,140
Wow, sweetie,
you really live in a remote place.

267
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,309
It's basically falling apart.

268
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,520
Honey, do people actually live here?

269
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,107
I mean, I'm not saying it's bad.
Are you upset?

270
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,944
What I meant was that I didn't know
people still lived in places like this.

271
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,698
This place must be undergoing
redevelopment.

272
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:21,955
Honey, I think you live in a place
that really doesn't suit your vibe. Right?

273
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,669
Wow. Let's take a look.

274
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,590
Honey, you have very unique taste.

275
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,550
I mean, I'm not saying it's weird.

276
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,556
Okay, this isn't the kind of thing
I'm used to.

277
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,268
Already?

278
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,562
Can I go wash up first?

279
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,275
Why is the floor…

280
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,195
What the heck?

281
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,907
Guess these people are your family.

282
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,078
This human has consumed too much alcohol.

283
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,080
Is this your father?

284
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,376
If you keep him alive for a while,
the alcohol will dissipate.

285
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,255
-What?
-How do we keep him alive quietly?

286
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,799
Who are you people?

287
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,219
Damn! You bastards must think
I'm some kind of pushover.

288
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,096
Should we sever his arms?

289
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,682
No, do not cut them off.

290
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,019
It'd be better to render him unconscious
and tie him up.

291
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,062
Hold on.

292
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,564
I mean, Jesus.

293
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,609
Hey, just you wait.
You don't seem to know who I am.

294
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,030
Don't kill me!

295
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,924
Get away from me!

296
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,972
Please save me!

297
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,727
<i>Target one eliminated!</i>

298
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,778
<i>Target in sight!</i>

299
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,042
<i>Target two eliminated!</i>

300
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,226
<i>Two targets, down!</i>

301
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,352
Are you one of us?

302
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
Have you been captured?

303
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
Don't touch that.

304
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,827
It's mine.

305
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,223
<i>A target has escaped</i>
<i>to the west side of the roof!</i>

306
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,766
Captain, are you okay?

307
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,518
Damn. I tried to catch it alive.

308
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,228
You tried to catch it alive?

309
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,730
It'd be good to catch it alive.

310
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,358
We're short of Hunting Dogs.

311
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,401
Honey, you're okay, right?

312
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,987
How's it going inside?

313
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,281
Everything is done. We've killed them all.

314
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,826
What about that asshole?

315
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,578
He seemed to be in shock,
so we sent him to the hospital.

316
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,039
Good. You sent one of our guys
to keep an eye on him?

317
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:33,957
Yes.

318
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,881
Wow. They're all working together now.

319
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,801
Were they having
some kind of get-together today?

320
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,136
There isn't much here.

321
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,222
These seem to belong to the victims.

322
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,858
Open that door.

323
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,308
What is that?

324
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,268
Call the forensics team.

325
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,941
What do you think it means?

326
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,193
It's the symbol for their pantry.

327
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,528
Sorry?

328
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,157
Those bastards have formed
an organization.

329
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,216
Are you certain she was one of us?

330
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,350
If she is, we must bring her
into our organization.

331
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,020
Okay.

332
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,897
I will go now.

333
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,781
<i>So many people seem to be</i>
<i>having trouble falling asleep.</i>

334
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,243
<i>If you're having trouble sleeping</i>
<i>because of your worries</i>,

335
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,538
<i>just like this person</i>
<i>who sent in their story at this late hour,</i>

336
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,999
<i>how about drinking a cup of warm water?</i>

337
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,125
<i>Have a good night.</i>

338
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,937
MR. CHUL-MIN

339
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,402
Who are you?

340
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,946
Why are you doing this?

341
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
You are good at pretending to be human.

342
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,830
What? What does that even mean?

343
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,874
Are you one of us?

344
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,793
She seems different.

345
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,045
What do you want from me?

346
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,173
We must check.

347
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,428
Oh fuck!

348
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,864
I am one of you.

349
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,544
If you are one of us,
you must join our organization.

350
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,589
We must combine our forces to survive.

SAEJIN CHURCH

00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,099
Since you are one of us,
you are always welcome.

353

354
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,854
Merry! Where are you?

Merry--

You saw everything, did you not?

357
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,247
I did not want
to draw any needless attention,

358
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,791
but I have no choice except to kill you.

359
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,752
Then fucking kill me!

360
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,669
Oh, I'm sorry.

361
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,298
Why were you here watching us?

362
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,178
My sister was acting weird,
so I followed her here.

363
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,724
Are you saying
your sister is one of my kin?

364
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,226
Yes.

365
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,564
Give me your wallet.

366
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,742
IDENTIFICATION CARD
SEOL KANG-WOO

367
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,832
Listen carefully to what I tell you now.

368
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,085
If you do not do as I say,

369
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,005
I will find you and kill you.

370
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,677
Do you understand?

371
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,082
Ms. Jeong Su-in?

372
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,339
Fucking hell, that monster was right.

373
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,176
Who are you?

374
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,470
I'll make this quick.

375
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,058
You've been sensing unpleasant brain waves
from certain people lately, right?

376
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,396
Don't go to those people, okay?
They're all monsters.

377
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,148
That was the message.

378
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,525
What are you talking about?

379
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,445
I heard you almost got killed
by a lunatic.

380
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
That you got stabbed.

381
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,366
When that happened, a monster…
I mean, what do I even call this?

382
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,038
The larva of a monster went
into your body, Ms. Jeong Su-in, okay?

383
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,915
Normally, it's supposed to
eat up your entire brain.

384
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,208
You were so badly injured,

385
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,961
healing your body prevented it
from consuming your whole brain.

386
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,713
You were supposed to mutate--

387
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,758
Fuck! What the hell am I even saying?

388
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,387
So the thing is, simply put,

389
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,306
you're a mutant, okay?

390
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,351
You know Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde, yeah? Hyde?

391
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,937
-Who told you this?
-You. Mr. Hyde.

392
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,483
Mr. Hyde, you're in there, right?
I told her everything, okay?

393
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,525
I'm off now.

394
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,613
Give me that.

395
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,845
IS THERE REALLY SOMEONE ELSE IN MY BODY…?

396
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,571
<i>Everything is exactly</i>
<i>what he said earlier.</i>

397
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,531
<i>Believe everything he said.</i>

398
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,576
<i>I need to explain</i>
<i>our condition to you in detail.</i>

399
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,662
<i>So write down all of your questions.</i>

400
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,178
WHO ARE YOU? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU?

401
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,941
NAMIL POLICE STATION

402
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,741
What is all this?

403
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,251
Raise your arms
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

404
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,629
You may enter.

405
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,882
-Oh, Captain. Good morning.
-Hi.

406
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,718
What is this? Is a VIP visiting or what?

407
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,512
-Raise your arms…
-You know…

408
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,348
They said a special task force
from Seoul is here.

409
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,766
Certainly special, indeed.

410
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,310
What? What kind of task force is it?

411
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
Special. A very special one.

412
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,940
They said there'll be a briefing,
so we'll find out.

413
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:48,857
Stop.

414
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,152
Raise your arms
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

415
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,033
You may enter.

416
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,661
Am I good?

417
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,830
Yes, you may enter.

418
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:08,961
Good day, then.

419
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,298
Hey, what is all of this?

420
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,800
I hate starting the day
with a gun pointed at me.

421
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,932
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

422
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,731
When did they prepare all of this?

423
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,162
"Body snatchers"?

424
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,207
Wow. Hey, what is all that?

425
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,958
Wow. They've prepared a lot.

426
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,251
Jeez!

427
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,931
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO PARASITE
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

428
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,768
Hello, everyone here
at Namil Police Station.

429
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,147
Chief, thank you so much
for being here today.

430
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,318
Okay, everyone, shall we give the chief
a round of applause?

431
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,701
Well, let me start by introducing myself.

432
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,081
My name is Choi Jun-kyung, team captain

433
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,959
of the parasite special forces unit,
Team Grey.

434
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,548
It must've been such a hassle for you all
to get screened this morning.

435
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,093
Well, I'll tell you the bottom line first.

436
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:26,181
We took X-rays of your bodies
this morning.

437
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,392
And among you,

438
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,270
we found

439
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,896
no parasites!

440
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,106
A round of applause!

441
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,110
What is this,
some kindergarten talent show?

442
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,405
Well, do we have to do this daily?

443
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,322
Not at all.

444
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,117
The screening was only required today.

445
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,663
That's because the parasites
showed up all at once,

446
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,041
and it seems they have already finished
synchronizing with human hosts.

447
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,713
So it has been confirmed,
based on the one-time screening today,

448
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,840
that none of you are parasites.

449
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,093
My saying "parasite this"
and "parasite that" must seem strange.

450
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,305
So let me explain.

451
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,602
EDM FESTIVAL
SUSPECT DEAD AT THE SCENE

452
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,603
So, you all remember

453
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,565
the case of the motiveless killing
at an EDM festival recently, right?

454
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,819
The truth behind the incident
you're all aware of…

455
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,697
is this.

456
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:29,536
The monster you see here
ruthlessly slashing away at people

457
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,788
is a parasite.

458
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,626
You might wonder where it is
and what it is doing now, right?

459
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,671
Right now, he is…

460
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,841
right here!

461
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,972
In order to prevent social chaos,

462
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:53,352
Team Grey put together a team
to restrict media access

463
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:57,940
and have been strictly controlling
all information about this parasite.

464
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,443
A few months ago,

465
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:06,406
the larvae of this parasite started
popping up all over Korea,

466
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,283
as well as all over the world.

467
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,955
The origin of these larvae
is still unknown.

468
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,250
Once they penetrate the human body,

469
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,878
through the ears, nose, or mouth,
they then take over the brain.

470
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,382
They consume the brain.

471
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,845
Now, once the parasites complete
their mutation,

472
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,515
they follow their instincts
and try to eat humans.

473
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,433
Here is an important characteristic.

474
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,646
They can freely transform their head.

475
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:42,651
These parasites can transform
their rigidity and shape

476
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,821
and change their heads
into something like sharp blades.

477
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,781
The cell itself

478
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,868
is an independent living organism
capable of processing thoughts.

479
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,370
These terrifying creatures

480
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:58,333
have infiltrated human society
and are targeting us right now.

481
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,713
<i>At first, I was a larva.</i>

482
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,799
<i>I followed my instincts</i>
<i>to take over a human brain,</i>

483
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,259
<i>leading me to go after yours.</i>

484
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,987
<i>So I tried to eat your brain</i>
<i>and parasitize your body</i>,

485
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,824
<i>but then I realized</i>
<i>your body was seriously wounded.</i>

486
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,202
<i>So I tried to synchronize</i>
<i>with your entire body</i>

487
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,121
<i>to heal the wounds first.</i>

488
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,249
<i>As a result, I was able to save your body</i>

489
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,295
<i>but I failed</i>
<i>to take over your brain completely.</i>

490
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,631
<i>Once synchronized, the parasite</i>

491
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,759
completely takes over the human brain.

492
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:54,014
And the human consciousness is also
entirely absorbed by the parasites.

493
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,643
So they're no longer the humans
we once knew.

494
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,228
Their brains have been taken over.

495
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,899
Now only their bodies live on,

496
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:08,320
becoming nothing but a source
of nourishment to these parasites.

497
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,740
<i>Because I failed to take over your brain,</i>

498
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,494
<i>I can only take over your brain</i>
<i>when you face danger</i>

499
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,789
<i>to protect this body we share.</i>

500
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,127
<i>Based on my experiments</i>
<i>with your body so far,</i>

501
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,632
<i>I can only take over your consciousness</i>
<i>for about 15 minutes a day.</i>

502
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,512
<i>So I'm using</i>
<i>the bare minimum amount of time</i>

503
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,139
<i>to protect this body and sustain my life.</i>

504
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,600
Excuse me.

505
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,938
What can we do to kill the parasites?

506
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,858
Well, the parasites will
wither away and die

507
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,443
without a human host.

508
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,823
So, to attack the parasite,

509
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,826
we need to destroy the human body.

510
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,287
That means you must destroy
the human body the parasite lives in.

511
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,873
So you have to cause
a massive hemorrhage at once

512
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,292
or destroy the heart in one go.

513
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,006
So, rather than a rifle,
which has a small impact point,

514
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,091
using a knife…

515
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,099
or a shotgun like this

516
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,518
is more effective

517
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:26,565
in destroying the heart in one go.

518
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,779
Is X-ray imaging the only way
to identify parasites?

519
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,616
Well, these parasites
are mingling among us,

520
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,201
pretending to be human beings.

521
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:42,497
But it's not like we can carry around
an X-ray machine at all times, right?

522
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,460
You can pluck out a strand of hair.

523
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,545
IDENTIFYING PARASITES

524
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,797
The parasites are made up
of a single cell mass.

525
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,383
{\an8}They can live briefly
even if they are cut into pieces.

526
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,886
{\an8}But the smaller the pieces
they divide into,

527
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,345
{\an8}the less intelligent they get,

528
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,681
{\an8}and they lose the ability
to return to their form.

529
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,562
If it is as small as a strand of hair,
it will wither and crumble away.

530
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,149
So, if you suspect someone around you,

531
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,235
pluck out a strand of their hair.

532
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,782
Then, I'll move on to the next part.

533
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,494
Fortunate or not,
in the case of our country,

534
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,913
the parasite showed up at an EDM festival

535
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,584
and went on a rampage,
killing people, as you saw earlier.

536
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,878
So the numerous pieces
of evidence left behind

537
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,047
revealed the existence of these parasites.

538
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,966
A parasite task force
was formed faster here

539
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,636
than in any other country in the world.

540
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,388
Therefore, our research was expedited.

541
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:45,227
And the one who sped up that research was…

542
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,904
my husband.

543
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,864
-What? Her husband?
-Oh my.

544
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,619
Or to be more precise, the parasite
who took over my husband's brain.

545
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,955
Don't be afraid.

546
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:09,334
Now, the mask over this one's head
is fitted with a special device.

547
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,629
This mask is equipped with a device

548
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,382
that sprays a chemical the parasites hate.

549
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,928
So if you press the button
on this remote control…

550
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,099
it sprays out the chemical,

551
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,768
and the parasite will be immobilized.

552
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,063
Also, there's a sensor inside this mask.

553
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,024
So if this thing tries
to transform its head and escape,

554
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,278
the sensor will release
the chemical automatically,

555
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,405
causing it immense pain.

556
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,490
Excuse me.

557
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,953
But why are you keeping that thing alive?

558
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,915
One of the characteristics
we have discovered about parasites is

559
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,962
that they can use brain waves
to detect other parasites around them.

560
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,798
So, we are using this one

561
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,094
as a radar to detect other parasites.

562
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:06,057
We call this parasite "the Hunting Dog."

563
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,313
<i>The people with whom you have</i>
<i>a strange feeling are our kin.</i>

564
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,858
<i>And they can also sense</i>
<i>that you are one of them.</i>

565
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,529
<i>But if they discover you are a mutant,</i>
<i>they might try eliminating you.</i>

566
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,908
<i>So approaching any of them</i>
<i>is too dangerous</i>

567
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,911
<i>if you wish to continue to survive.</i>

568
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,122
<i>I am trying to warn you of that.</i>

569
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,292
<i>It is crucial</i>
<i>that we know each other clearly,</i>

570
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,502
<i>so I left a video of myself</i>
<i>on your cell phone.</i>

571
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,492
<i>Our Hunting Dog has informed us</i>

572
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,704
that the highest concentration
of parasites is in Namil-gun,

573
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,706
where Namil Police Station is located.

574
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:18,421
We plan to stay here for a few days
and hunt down the parasites.

575
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:23,551
If there have been any unsolved murders
or suspicious cases recently,

576
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,928
please report them to us.

577
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:29,766
Those cases may be related to parasites.

578
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,934
Do you understand?

579
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:32,978
I mean,

580
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,190
isn't it unethical
to torment a human like that?

581
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,733
Come again?

582
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,618
If you think like that

583
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,037
for even one moment…

584
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,465
then this will happen to you.

585
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,730
This thing is no longer my husband.

586
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,276
It is nothing but a monster, an insect,
a virus that needs to be exterminated!

587
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,445
Once they've become parasites,

588
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,864
you can't consider them human anymore!

589
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,199
Do you understand?

590
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:29,951
Got it?

591
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:33,009
