1
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,041
We're under attack!

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,041
Attack!

3
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,375
Watch out, Katara! There's a new group
coming in starboard side.

4
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,666
Aang, contain the soldiers at the front.

5
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,625
I got some things to take care of.
Appa, yip yip!

6
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,958
Come on. Let's go.

7
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:50,958
Let's go!

8
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,666
Hyah!

9
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,166
Hyah!

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,875
Nice job, troops.
Those flame heads aren't going anywhere.

11
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,750
Thanks to your plan.

12
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,041
And some kick-ass teamwork.

13
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,208
One ship down.

14
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,500
How many more to go?

15
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,291
You gotta be kidding me.

16
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,875
The wall is impenetrable
and heavily guarded.

17
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,208
The surrounding cliffs are hundreds
of feet high. Impossible to scale.

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,708
I know you think I'm being reckless,
but Zhao has cornered the Avatar,

19
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,875
and he's not gonna stop
until he has him, so neither can I.

20
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,458
One way or another,
this is where my journey ends.

21
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,541
Search the coastline for fissures,

22
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,083
signs of warm water outflows
from the city.

23
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,708
They could provide a pathway inside.

24
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,541
Uncle…

25
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,291
Lu Ten would have been proud…

26
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,875
to have you as his father.

27
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,333
Remember your Breath of Fire.
It could save your life out there.

28
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,125
We'll meet again.

29
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,500
After… I have the Avatar.

30
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,416
Just forget about engaging them at sea.

31
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,916
Even with all of your benders
on all of your boats,

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,291
their numbers are just too great.

33
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
Then we make our stand here.

34
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,166
How far away are they?

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,125
They'll probably be in range
in an hour. Two, tops.

36
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
We need to call the patrols home.

37
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,750
Shore up the defensive lines.

38
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,208
Thank you.

39
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,666
This is bad, isn't it?

40
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,291
They mean business, but so do we.
I'd say it's 50-50.

41
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,416
60-40.

42
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,666
Where are you going?

43
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,458
To even the odds.

44
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,166
Forgive me, Admiral,
but I'm confused.

45
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,416
You're wondering why
the command ship isn't leading the attack.

46
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,625
It does seem an unusual strategy.

47
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,750
Weren't you the one who pointed out
a frontal assault on the Waterbenders

48
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,958
would be fruitless?

49
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,041
Well, yes, but--

50
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,875
So it would make sense
to attack on multiple fronts.

51
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,916
Open a new front? With one ship?

52
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,958
One ship, but not one vessel.

53
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,333
Fire Nation engineers created this?

54
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,625
Oh, this isn't our work.

55
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,750
No, this comes courtesy
of our spies in Omashu.

56
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,541
This is just a prototype.

57
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,083
Even if you use this
to bypass Agna Qel'a's main defenses,

58
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,625
it's far too small to carry
any kind of significant fighting force.

59
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
You, of all people, should know

60
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,708
that victory doesn't always depend
on the numbers,

61
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,875
but it should get the job done.

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,750
Job? What job?

63
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,458
Fire!

64
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,541
Incoming!

65
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,541
Hurry!

66
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,125
Ice shields now!

67
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,000
-I'm here to help.
-Now is not the time, Katara.

68
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,083
Now is exactly the time!

69
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,500
Thought I made myself clear.
Women are not allowed in combat.

70
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,166
I thought I showed you how stupid that is.
Forget your pride.

71
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,333
This is about the survival
of the Waterbenders,

72
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,500
and you need all the help you can get.

73
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,833
You know we can make a difference.

74
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,458
"We"?

75
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,083
All they want is what you want.

76
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,583
A chance to defend their home.

77
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:27,666
Pakku, what good is it relying on the past
when it stops us from having a future?

78
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,708
Get… get over yourself, you old fool,
and let us get the job done!

79
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,375
Western side of the wall
needs reinforcement.

80
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,583
You can help them repair the damage

81
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,875
and see if their warriors need
any other assistance.

82
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,041
The entire city will be in range soon.

83
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,333
If the Firebenders breach the wall,
you'll be the first line of defense.

84
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,416
We'll be ready.

85
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:04,916
Yue!

86
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,541
I'm not going to hide
while everyone is risking their lives.

87
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
-Listen to me.
-No.

88
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,541
You have to stop being overprotective.

89
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,500
Yue,

90
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,125
if anything should happen to me,

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,250
you must take over.

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,708
You are the future
of the Northern Water Tribe.

93
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,541
My daughter.

94
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,541
My gift.

95
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,375
Sokka.

96
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,541
I need you to go with Yue

97
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,458
and help her move the people
away from the wall.

98
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,625
But most importantly,

99
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,541
make sure the princess stays safe.

100
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,958
I swear I won't leave her side.

101
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,000
Sokka.

102
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,041
Take care of her.

103
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,666
Come on!

104
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,416
We're here to help.

105
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,125
-Master Pakku told us to report to you.
-Pakku sent you to me?

106
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,208
He told us to help you in any way we can.

107
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:30,500
We haven't finished our training yet,
but… we'll try our best.

108
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,833
You can start by reinforcing that section.

109
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,500
If you spot incoming fireballs,
don't try to take them on yourself.

110
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,500
-Let me know.
-Yes, Master Katara.

111
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,750
What? I'm not a…

112
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,541
Admiral, the Waterbenders
draw their strength from the moon,

113
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,791
and on a night like tonight,
their powers will be at their peak.

114
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,041
I suggest you pause the attack
until daybreak.

115
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,708
No.

116
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,166
I have been studying up
on matters beyond this realm,

117
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,083
which is why I know
that that isn't just any moon.

118
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,875
It's the Ice Moon,

119
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,750
a rare cosmic event.

120
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:31,125
The barriers between
the physical and spirit worlds

121
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,250
grow thin… on this night.

122
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,708
When I received the Fire Lord's orders
to conquer the North,

123
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,333
I knew brute force wasn't gonna be enough.

124
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,000
I needed an edge.

125
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,583
Nothing.

126
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,333
Just a bunch of mumbo jumbo
about lion turtles

127
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,958
and cosmic balance and push and pull.

128
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,083
And yet there is wisdom
to be gleaned from the old tales.

129
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:08,125
Agna Qel'a… is built on the site
of the ancestral home of the water tribe,

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,125
an oasis deep in the ice

131
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,750
that provided warmth and nourishment
for their people in the harsh environment.

132
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,500
It was from this oasis

133
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,916
that the tribe looked up to the sky

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,958
and learned to waterbend

135
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,708
by watching the moon
push and pull the tides.

136
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,458
And so the Waterbenders believe

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,750
their lives come from
the spirit of the ocean,

138
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,666
while their powers come from
the spirit of the moon.

139
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,791
These same spirits
give up their immortality

140
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,541
for one night every year
to be among the Waterbenders.

141
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,708
They take physical form
and become part of the mortal world.

142
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,708
They appear in this world?

143
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,750
In order to better understand

144
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,583
the balance between light and darkness,

145
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,125
yin and yang,

146
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,333
life…

147
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,875
And death.

148
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:16,166
Zhao, you're not thinking of tampering
with the Spirit World, are you?

149
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,875
Are you?

150
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,541
Aang.

151
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,708
Aang.

152
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,250
Aang.

153
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,750
Avatar Kuruk?

154
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,833
I've come to warn you.

155
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,416
My knife is near. I can sense it.

156
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,583
Knife?

157
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,625
One created with materials
from the Spirit World.

158
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,333
And if it has returned to the North,
it can only mean one thing.

159
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,208
<i>You're going to kill</i>
<i>the ocean and moon spirits?</i>

160
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,916
Of course not.

161
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,916
Killing the ocean spirit

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
would deprive Waterbenders
around the world of their lives.

163
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,791
Men, women, children.

164
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,166
I'm not a monster.

165
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,458
No.

166
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,875
I'm only gonna kill the moon.

167
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:18,333
Zhao cannot be allowed to meddle
with the primal forces of nature.

168
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,125
In doing so, he will throw
the entire world out of balance.

169
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,875
The Avatar's power is great,

170
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,708
but it pales before the power
of the elemental spirits.

171
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,041
There you are.

172
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,875
When I didn't see you up there,
I got worried.

173
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,500
- Help!
- I'm coming!

174
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,041
Are you okay?

175
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,125
We need to find Sokka and Yue.
Something terrible is about to happen.

176
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
Everyone, head to the palace!

177
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,041
You'll be safer there.

178
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, it's okay.

179
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,166
You're okay.

180
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,000
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

181
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank you.

182
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,958
Good job, Momo.
You actually made yourself useful…

183
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:10,916
Momo?

184
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,666
Is he--

185
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,666
Alive?

186
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,000
Barely.

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Here.

188
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,125
Come with me. I can help him.
We don't have much time.

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,666
Where are we?

190
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,333
It's the most sacred spot
in the North.

191
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,875
The waters that feed this grove
are heated by the earth.

192
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,625
Here, give him to me.

193
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,291
This is where the priest brought me
when I was sick.

194
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,958
To the source of all spiritual energy
in our land.

195
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,958
Momo!

196
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,708
You dumb dummy. Don't scare me like that.

197
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you.

198
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,541
Sokka, what is that?

199
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,125
Something that shouldn't be here.

200
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,416
It's a war balloon.

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,541
A war balloon?

202
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,958
Stolen from Omashu.

203
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,000
From what I can tell, this one's
not designed for combat, just transport.

204
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,625
How do you know that?

205
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Because I helped design the thing.

206
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,416
The sage didn't know

207
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,833
the precise form
the ocean and moon spirits will take,

208
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:09,250
and that, General, is… where you come in.

209
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,541
Since you're so well-versed
in spiritual matters,

210
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,916
I need your help identifying them.

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,500
I have no idea what to look for.

212
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,791
This isn't like
trying to find a lost puppy.

213
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,166
They could appear as a pair of trees
in a grove or insects on a blade of grass.

214
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,041
Well, we won't know
until we start looking, right?

215
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,416
General Iroh,
either you help me find the spirits

216
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,875
or watch as I burn
this whole place to the ground.

217
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,041
<i>Can Avatar Kuruk</i>
<i>protect the spirits?</i>

218
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,833
No, but I know where we need to go.

219
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,916
Avatar!

220
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
There's nowhere left to run.

221
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,583
Zuko, listen to me. We need to stop Zhao.

222
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:02,333
This isn't about Zhao. This is about us!
And you're coming with me now!

223
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,250
Go.

224
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
Stop Zhao.

225
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,583
I'll deal with him.

226
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,166
Go easy.

227
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,458
Enough people have been hurt already.

228
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,791
I don't care.

229
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,250
I wasn't talking to you.

230
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
You've learned some new tricks,

231
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,750
but I didn't come this far to lose to you.

232
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,458
You little peasant!

233
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,250
You found a master, haven't you?

234
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,208
Yes. You're looking at her.

235
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,250
We got company.

236
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,083
Keep moving.

237
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,541
We need to stop Zhao.

238
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,750
He's trying to kill
the ocean and moon spirits.

239
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,375
He can't.
That would mean the end of our people.

240
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,125
We can't let that happen.

241
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,208
Push and pull. Yin and yang.

242
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,916
Yes…

243
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,041
Yes!

244
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,500
Zhao,

245
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,500
the power of the spirits
is not to be trifled with.

246
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,958
Without the moon,
the world will be thrown out of balance,

247
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,708
and chaos will be unleashed.

248
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,916
Even Ozai wouldn't want that.

249
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Ozai lacks vision.

250
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,458
He's so fixated on the games
he's playing with his family,

251
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,750
he can't see the bigger picture.

252
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:48,333
Zhao, whatever you do to that spirit,
I'll unleash on you tenfold!

253
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,458
Spare me your empty threats.

254
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,541
This can still work out for you, Iroh.

255
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,458
Once I take my place as the new Fire Lord,
you can stand by my side.

256
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,958
Your presence
will lend legitimacy to my claim.

257
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,000
The Dragon of the West can rise again.

258
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,208
As long as he bows…

259
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,041
before Zhao,

260
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,750
the Moon Slayer!

261
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,791
I am a legend now!

262
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,416
They will tell stories about me!

263
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,000
For generations. Zhao the Moon Slayer.

264
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,166
Zhao!

265
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,916
You're too late, Avatar.

266
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,583
Zhao, don't.

267
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,000
No matter what you think,
this isn't power.

268
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:57,916
No?

269
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,375
Do you realize what I can do?

270
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,291
I can wipe out an entire race of benders.

271
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,500
Can you imagine what that's like?

272
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:08,958
Yes.

273
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,000
I can.

274
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,000
You wanna rule the world,
but if you do this,

275
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,750
there won't be a world to rule.

276
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,750
So release the spirit,
and I'll go with you… peacefully.

277
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,791
You think anyone cares about you?

278
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:33,125
How much of a threat will the Avatar be
once I eliminate waterbending

279
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,708
from the world?

280
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,375
Master of Three Elements

281
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,708
doesn't quite have
the same ring to it, does it?

282
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,125
Let's face it. You don't matter anymore.

283
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,625
Actually, I'm not sure you ever did!

284
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,750
You're right.

285
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,500
I don't matter.

286
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
The world needed the Avatar…

287
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,583
and I failed.

288
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,125
Touching.

289
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,083
Not that I care.

290
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,583
Yue!

291
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,750
What's happening?

292
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,000
I can't bend!

293
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,875
I can't bend!

294
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,125
Warriors, the city has been breached!

295
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,000
Get out!

296
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,750
Fall back!

297
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,833
Fall back! Fall back!

298
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,625
We're almost there.

299
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,416
Go! We'll cover your retreat.

300
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,291
The moon is gone.

301
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,333
There's no hope now.

302
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,041
It's over.

303
00:26:55,791 --> 00:27:00,458
Being the Avatar means putting your duties
above all else, even your life!

304
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:04,458
The Avatar has to make
the impossible choices,

305
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,833
placing the world's needs
ahead of your needs.

306
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,708
The Avatar's power is great,

307
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:13,416
but it pales before the power
of the elemental spirits.

308
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,916
No.

309
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,083
It's not over.

310
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,041
Aang, don't do this.

311
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,625
You'll be lost forever.

312
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,041
I should have been lost
a hundred years ago.

313
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,291
This isn't my time or my world.

314
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,541
I couldn't save my world,
but I can save this one.

315
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,083
Run!

316
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,333
What…

317
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,791
what just happened?

318
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,916
Aang has given himself over
to the ocean spirit,

319
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,083
allowing it to channel its rage
through him

320
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,833
and access the power of the Avatar.

321
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,666
We've gotta reach him.

322
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,166
No, you don't understand.

323
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,000
There is no Aang anymore.

324
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,166
Yue!

325
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,208
Zuko!

326
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,875
Thank the spirits you're alive!

327
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,750
Uncle, what… what is that?

328
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,166
That…

329
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,375
that is Wrath.

330
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,750
-The Avatar!
-There is no Avatar.

331
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,416
Not anymore.

332
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,916
-We must go!
-No. No.

333
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,708
- Zuko, we must!
- We can't.

334
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,041
We must!

335
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,791
Aang.

336
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,875
Fire!

337
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,875
Zuko, don't!

338
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,958
Let me go.

339
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,208
He's a small man
who's gonna meet a small end.

340
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,791
He took everything from me.

341
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,958
Zhao!

342
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,250
You're alive.

343
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,333
Traitor.

344
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,666
Coward!

345
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:17,583
You ruined everything!
The Avatar was mine. My mission was--

346
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,083
Your mission

347
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:20,916
was a sham.

348
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,791
Did you really think the Fire Lord
was gonna take you back?

349
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,250
Ozai was playing with you.

350
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,916
It was all a game.

351
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:39,791
And the winner is the one
without the scar from Daddy.

352
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,666
Ozai was just using you

353
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,208
as motivation for your sister.

354
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:53,958
You lie.

355
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,625
You're lying! Admit it, you're lying!

356
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:02,916
Who do you think was my ally…
through all this?

357
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,541
<i>Who convinced the Fire Lord</i>
<i>to send me the Yuyan archers?</i>

358
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:14,166
Who identified
the Blue Spirit's swords as yours?

359
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,666
<i>Azula told me everything I needed to know.</i>

360
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,166
You are the fire

361
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,125
in which her iron was forged.

362
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,916
That's all you were.

363
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:12,833
Come, nephew.

364
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,000
What is it?

365
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,541
- Come! We must go!
- Go!

366
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,708
Fire!

367
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,125
Is it dead?

368
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,875
No! No! No!

369
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,833
Aang!

370
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,666
Aang!

371
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,208
Aang!

372
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,708
It's over!

373
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,833
Please come back!

374
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,500
<i>Aang is lost.</i>

375
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,958
<i>All that's left is a vengeful spirit</i>

376
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,500
<i>who will roam endlessly</i>
<i>looking for its partner</i>

377
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,833
<i>but will never find it.</i>

378
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,125
The world will be forever out of balance.

379
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,250
There must be something we can do.
Some way to bring the moon back to life.

380
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,041
Sokka.

381
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,750
Thank you.

382
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,375
Yue, what are you doing?

383
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:51,791
I was touched by the moon spirit
as a child, so I have its life within me.

384
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,375
It's time for me to give it back.

385
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,458
This isn't a sad thing.

386
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:06,250
Do you know why the ocean and moon spirits

387
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,166
take physical form for a night?

388
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:12,291
It's because they wanna know
what it is to be mortal.

389
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,500
It's worth the risk to be alive.

390
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,166
Even for just one night.

391
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,000
Especially for one night.

392
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,500
Just please come back!

393
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,583
Aang, don't be an idiot!

394
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,250
You're not just the Avatar.
You're my family!

395
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:41,125
This is your world!
This is your home! We are your family!

396
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,250
Aang!

397
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,458
Yue, please. Please don't!

398
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,125
No! No!

399
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,208
Please, you don't have to do this!

400
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,875
Yue, no. No.

401
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,791
No.

402
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,708
No.

403
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:02,666
Yue!

404
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:49,791
Aang,

405
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:51,708
listen to me.

406
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:56,083
I know you think
you don't belong in this world,

407
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,916
but you were never meant to die
a hundred years ago.

408
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,000
If you had,

409
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,166
you wouldn't be here now,
and the world needs you.

410
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,041
I need you.

411
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,958
So much destruction.

412
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,625
Hahn.

413
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,541
I'm sorry I couldn't protect her.

414
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,000
My daughter always made her own choices.

415
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,375
And that was not something you

416
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,208
or anyone could have stopped.

417
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,875
She sacrificed herself
for all of us.

418
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,750
Me…

419
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,208
I watched it happen.

420
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:32,666
I stood on the sidelines
while others fought and died,

421
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,708
being the warrior I could never be.

422
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:39,458
Sokka, in a moment
when she must have been scared,

423
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,458
you made sure she wasn't alone.

424
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,500
You don't have to be a warrior

425
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,541
to be a hero.

426
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,833
I thought I'd never see
the light of a new day,

427
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,625
but the sun rises,
and the water tribe is still here.

428
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,166
So much was lost.

429
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:12,416
Yes, but we'll rebuild,
and we'll emerge stronger.

430
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:19,708
Do you remember how I told you
water is the element of change?

431
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,416
I'd forgotten what that truly meant.

432
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:27,875
Change is the key to new life.

433
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,708
You reminded me of that,

434
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,791
and I'm deeply grateful that you did.

435
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:45,291
You know, there's a whole new generation
of Waterbenders who will need training.

436
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,041
We could use your help.

437
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,541
Thanks.

438
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:59,208
But Aang still has a journey to complete,
and so do I.

439
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,416
After all, the Avatar
still has to learn waterbending.

440
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,416
In that case, he couldn't have asked
for a better master.

441
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,291
Hmm. For you.

442
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,875
What is it?

443
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:23,125
Water from our oasis.

444
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,958
A reminder of what we've gone through

445
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,375
and an invitation to return

446
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,625
anytime.

447
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:53,541
Lieutenant Jee would have known
to stay out of the worst of the battle.

448
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,083
He and the crew
may be looking for us right now.

449
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,583
What do you think, Prince Zuko?

450
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,958
What do you want to do?

451
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,375
I don't know.

452
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,625
I'm tired.

453
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,375
Then you should rest.

454
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,291
A man needs his rest.

455
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,666
I caused this.

456
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,333
No, the Fire Nation did.

457
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Because I failed to be the Avatar.

458
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,958
How do I do this
without causing so much pain?

459
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,625
Aang, this is war.

460
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,791
There's going to be losses.
There's going to be pain.

461
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,541
None of that is your fault.

462
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,333
And the Firebenders aren't giving up.

463
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,208
We have to prepare
for whatever they throw at us next.

464
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,000
And so stop worrying about the past,

465
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,208
and start thinking about
what you still have to do.

466
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,750
I think I understand something
Gyatso was trying to tell me.

467
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:40,750
He told me let go of the past,
or I'll never have a future.

468
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That's right.

469
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,166
You're gonna learn waterbending,
and I'm gonna make sure of that.

470
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,833
And then earthbending…

471
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,416
Which means back to Omashu.

472
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,875
So,

473
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,041
anyone else hungry?

474
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,666
Why is everything
always about your stomach?

475
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,291
-Because that's where his brain is.
-Oh, says the kid with the melon head.

476
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,458
Ooh, I could go for a melon.

477
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:18,291
See?
Food is always the right answer.

478
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,750
Just gotta listen to Sokka.

479
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,416
<i>Agna Qel'a took heavy damage,</i>

480
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
but our forces were unable
to take the city.

481
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:34,791
Also, it seems
the Avatar remains alive and free.

482
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,541
Pity.

483
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,750
But not unexpected.

484
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,958
Conquering the North
was always an unlikely proposition.

485
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,541
If that was the case,
then why attack the North at all?

486
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,083
Distraction.

487
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,208
The North was never the true target.

488
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,416
<i>For the first time in a century,</i>

489
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,041
<i>Omashu is ours.</i>

490
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,083
<i>Now only Ba Sing Se stands between us</i>

491
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,208
<i>and the total conquest</i>
<i>of the Earth Kingdom.</i>

492
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,750
A brilliant strategy,

493
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,875
but was the Fire Lord aware

494
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,875
Prince Zuko was among
the forces at Agna Qel'a?

495
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,916
The loss of life among our troops
was substantial.

496
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,000
If Zuko is strong, he'll survive.

497
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,291
If not…

498
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,625
sometimes you have to sacrifice the weak

499
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,166
<i>to keep yourself strong.</i>

500
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,583
Omashu

501
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,958
is ours!

502
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,083
For the Fire Nation!

503
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,750
Fire Nation!

504
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,666
So…

505
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,125
what's next?

506
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,333
Measuring the movements of
the heavens has always proven difficult,

507
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,833
but we have devised a method
to better understand celestial motion.

508
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,333
It's taken a hundred years,

509
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:07,083
but the time finally draws near.

510
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:10,750
- When?
- Soon.

511
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,583
We shall see the return

512
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,041
of Sozin's Comet.
