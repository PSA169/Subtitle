1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,666
<i>We spend so much time</i>
<i>hiding who we really are,</i>

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,208
<i>making sure no one sees</i>
<i>the person we truly want to be.</i>

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,541
<i>So it's hard to remember there was a time</i>

4
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:32,708
<i>when we were truly excited</i>
<i>to show the world our true face.</i>

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,541
Very impressive.

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,125
That uniform suits you well.

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,625
Does it look right?
I had trouble with the shoulder guards.

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,833
There. Perfect.

9
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,708
-What… what is it?
-Nothing.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,833
Tell me.

11
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,708
Your gauntlets are laced
incorrectly, but no one will notice.

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,916
What? Help me fix it!

13
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,666
I remember
my first war council meeting.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,541
They were smaller affairs back then.
More private.

15
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,250
Ozai, however, seems to enjoy
having an audience.

16
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,416
Father says
he welcomes different opinions.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,083
I'd advise against testing that.
Best to observe and learn for now.

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,750
There.

19
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,541
How do I look?

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,750
Like a prince.

21
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,041
Why are we off course?
Who changed the heading?

22
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,166
-Lieutenant Jee, I asked you a question.
-We were given new orders.

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,333
- New orders? By who?
- By me.

24
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:54,958
We've been playing catch-up for too long.
I think it's time for a new strategy.

25
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,291
You think?

26
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,666
I am the one hunting the Avatar.

27
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,291
I am in charge of this mission.

28
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,958
I am the commander of this ship.

29
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,208
And I

30
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,875
am an admiral.

31
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,833
Fire Lord Ozai saw fit to put me

32
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,083
in charge of all operations
related to the capture of the Avatar.

33
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,708
Of course I welcome your assistance.

34
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,625
In fact, I expect it.

35
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,416
I'll need
all the resources at my disposal,

36
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,000
no matter how minimal.

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,333
I'll come by later

38
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:36,750
to discuss a few personnel changes
<i>I'd </i>like to make.

39
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,166
Until then, carry on.

40
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,541
What's happened?

41
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,250
Lieutenant Jee,
resume our original course.

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,541
Did you hear me?

43
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,833
Resume course!

44
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,416
Do you know
what the punishment for mutiny is?

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,083
I do, and that's why
I can't do what you say.

46
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,166
Admiral Zhao was very clear
with these orders

47
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,291
and what would happen
if we didn't follow them.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,750
Are you seriously gonna let
this spineless slug tell us what to do?

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,166
He doesn't know what's at stake!

50
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,583
We can't let him come in and take it away.
Not after everything we've been through.

51
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,791
For the last three years,
we've only had each other,

52
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,625
and that's still true.

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,375
Only those of us on this boat
know what it's been like.

54
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,833
Zhao is not the one
who deserves your loyalty.

55
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
- Zuko is.
- Loyalty?

56
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,958
General, with all due respect, your nephew
doesn't know the meaning of the word.

57
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,666
If he did, he would've shown us,

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,291
the people who've been with him
night and day for three years,

59
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,875
a lot more respect.

60
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:09,375
Instead, we've had to put up
with his insults and abuse and tantrums.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,916
He doesn't care
what we've had to sacrifice,

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,125
because he's never had
to sacrifice anything.

63
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,333
If you ask anyone here,
they'll tell you, "He may be a prince,

64
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,041
but he's not our prince."

65
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,416
Sir.

66
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,000
I know Zuko has his rough edges.

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,416
But you must understand
he's been through a lot.

68
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,083
And he knows far more about sacrifice
than you can ever know.

69
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,375
Greetings, wise sages.
I'm glad to see you.

70
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,083
Uh, my name is Aang, and I'm here
to visit the shrine of Avatar Roku.

71
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,791
You see,

72
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,666
I'm the Avatar.

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
We know.

74
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,916
Wait!

75
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,250
You're supposed to be men of peace!

76
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,541
After him!

77
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,333
I'm a friend.

78
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,000
This will take us
to Avatar Roku's shrine. Quickly.

79
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,500
He must be close.

80
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,833
Search everywhere!

81
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,916
Whoa. Easy, girl.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,125
Caught a scent, have we?

83
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, Nyla. Let's go.

84
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,000
My name is Shyu.

85
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:14,458
I believe the Avatar
represents not any one kingdom

86
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,708
but the hope of a unified world.

87
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,125
Sadly, the Great Sage
and the others believe

88
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,000
the Fire Lord
is their true spiritual leader.

89
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,416
They have lost their way.

90
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
So all of this belonged to Roku?

91
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
These are relics
from previous Avatars

92
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,208
that my grandfather gathered
for safekeeping.

93
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,000
I need to make contact
with Avatar Roku.

94
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,666
He's the only one
who can tell me how to save my friends.

95
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,166
I will hold them off for as long as I can.

96
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,583
Step aside.

97
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:59,083
Great Sage, this boy's the Avatar.
He is a hope for the world.

98
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,916
Remember the teachings of Avatar Roku.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,291
Fire is not meant
to dominate the other elements.

100
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,583
It should exist in balance with them.

101
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,666
The only one who can provide balance
is Fire Lord Ozai.

102
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,250
He will unify the world, not the Avatar.

103
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,708
And you have no idea
how powerful he will soon become.

104
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,125
Now, for the last time,

105
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
step aside.

106
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,208
I can't do that.

107
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,375
Then you shall burn
along with the rest of the nonbelievers.

108
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,791
Who dares disturb
the peace of the Avatar?

109
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,541
Uh, it's me. Aang.

110
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,875
Is it not customary
to bow before your elders?

111
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,291
And to avert your eyes?

112
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,541
And hop on one leg?

113
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,708
Forgive me!

114
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,208
I couldn't resist.

115
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,916
It's good to see you, Aang,

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,375
but what took you so long?

117
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,958
I thought you would come
to seek my advice sooner.

118
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,875
Avatar Kyoshi told me

119
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,958
that I need to figure things out
on my own.

120
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,625
That it was part of my journey.

121
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,500
Sounds like her.

122
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,541
Kyoshi has always been kind of…

123
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,708
I thought you'd all be like that.
Aren't Avatars incarnations of each other?

124
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,375
We share the same spark,
but we are our own people.

125
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm different from Kyoshi,

126
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,541
just as you are different
from either of us.

127
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,166
For instance, what did Kyoshi tell you
the role of the Avatar was?

128
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,500
She said I need to be
a fierce, merciless warrior.

129
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:57,166
Yes, there are times when the Avatar
must resort to force and intimidation,

130
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
but in addition to being a warrior,

131
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,958
the Avatar must also be a diplomat.

132
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,250
So we can solve the world's problems
without hurting anyone?

133
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:11,166
We can try,
but there are consequences if we fail.

134
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,458
Painful… consequences.

135
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,416
But like Kyoshi,
I am here to aid you in your journey.

136
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,750
Anything you need.

137
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,166
It has to do with Koh.

138
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,541
Anything but that.

139
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,916
-You don't understand--
-No, <i>you </i>don't understand.

140
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,291
Koh is a predatory spirit

141
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,958
who can hurt you in ways
you can't imagine.

142
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,583
Just ask Avatar Kuruk.

143
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,458
I don't have a choice,
and I'm running out of time.

144
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,375
<i>He's captured my friends,</i>
<i>and if I don't do something,</i>

145
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,625
<i>they'll be lost forever.</i>

146
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,416
Please.

147
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,333
I heard you defeated him once.

148
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,750
No, I never defeated him.

149
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,000
I only managed to take something from him.

150
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:56,375
Perhaps you've come
to return what you stole from me.

151
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,916
What did you take?

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,583
A totem that represents something
that Koh needs and cannot forget.

153
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,375
The pendant belonged
to the Mother of Faces,

154
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,833
an ancient spirit
who crafted faces for all living beings.

155
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:20,250
It's because of her
that identity came into this world.

156
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,375
And she

157
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,166
is Koh's mother.

158
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,416
Koh longs for the same thing we all do.

159
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,625
Family.

160
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,625
A totem?

161
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,041
Sounds like something
he'd be willing to trade for.

162
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,416
Thank you, Roku.

163
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Aang!

164
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,125
I hope that you're able
to save your friends.

165
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,250
But the truth is,
for the Avatar, friends can be…

166
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,583
a liability.

167
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,083
The Avatar has to make
the impossible choices,

168
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,208
placing the world's needs
ahead of your needs.

169
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,583
On that, Kyoshi and I agree.

170
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,375
Trust me.

171
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,875
It'll save you and the ones you love

172
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,541
a lot of pain.

173
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,041
<i>…a lot of pain.</i>

174
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,458
What happened to them?

175
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,708
Paralyzed.

176
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,041
Sh!

177
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,250
Everything's gonna be fine.

178
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:34,125
So you're the Avatar, huh?
Not sure what all the fuss is about.

179
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,125
You need to let me go.

180
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,833
No, really. You need to let me go.

181
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,875
People are depending on me.
You don't know what's at stake.

182
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,791
I've heard the stories
about how you're gonna save the world.

183
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,791
Here's the thing.

184
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,375
Some of us don't need saving.

185
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,958
Some of us
have got this world figured out.

186
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,000
You got your Firebenders
and your Earthbenders

187
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
and your whatever-benders,

188
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,166
and they all want something.

189
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,750
They're all willing to fight to get it.

190
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,500
So if you're smart, you just sit back
and wait for the dust to clear

191
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,166
and then pick through broken pieces
for the leftovers.

192
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,000
Far as I'm concerned,
world's just fine the way it is.

193
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,208
Time's up, Avatar.

194
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,083
You did it.

195
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,125
You actually got him.

196
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,833
Feel free to count it.

197
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,208
I trust you. You know why?

198
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,958
Because if there's any missing,
you'll come after us?

199
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,041
Because you're so cute.

200
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,666
Oh, and careful.
This one's got a lot of heat on him.

201
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
A bunch of hunters
have been sniffing around.

202
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,375
Folks not to be messed with.

203
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,625
See you around, Avatar.

204
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,708
Please just let me do what I have to do,
and I swear I'll come back.

205
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,708
My friends are in danger,
and I'm the only one who can save them.

206
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,500
If I don't return soon,
I'll lose them forever.

207
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,041
Why? Why don't you listen to me?

208
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,416
Do you know what it's like
to have people depending on you?

209
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,875
To have someone's life in your hands?

210
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:34,833
I do.

211
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,458
Then please let me save them!

212
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,000
No.

213
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,625
You couldn't have always been this way.

214
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,041
What happened to you?

215
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,625
The Earth Kingdom's forces
are concentrated along the southern coast.

216
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,583
We tried flanking them,
but they keep lengthening the line.

217
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,583
How about a pincer move?

218
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,541
They're anchored by cliffs.
They can outflank any attacks.

219
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,458
What would you do?

220
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,458
- Your Highness, I would suggest--
- Not you.

221
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,250
Zuko.

222
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,541
What would you do?

223
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,541
Um…

224
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:21,000
Horns tactic. Enveloping flanks,
leaving an escape route to draw them out.

225
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,791
Didn't you hear the general?
They're protected by cliffs on one side.

226
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,916
Tundra tanks to come over the top.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They're Earthbenders.

228
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,208
Our tanks would be
buried under rocks in seconds.

229
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,375
I…

230
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,458
I…

231
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,458
General.

232
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,416
We could advance a division… here.

233
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,333
With the enemy's firepower
focused on that diversion,

234
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,375
we can launch pinning attacks
here… and here.

235
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,458
If you send them into the heart
of their forces, how will they retreat?

236
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,458
They won't.

237
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,833
But they'll be lost.

238
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,291
You're gonna sacrifice them.

239
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,500
Sacrifice is a part of war.

240
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,458
What division do you suggest?

241
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,000
The 41st. They're mostly new recruits.

242
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,250
They're expendable.

243
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,333
Good.

244
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,916
This isn't something
you learn in a textbook.

245
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,208
Little boys should know better
than to play at war.

246
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,875
It's a terrible plan.

247
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,958
What did you say?

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,708
I said… it's a terrible plan!

249
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,208
Soldiers are gonna die, and for what?

250
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,916
It's unworthy of a Fire Nation officer.

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,375
You dare question--

252
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,708
Enough!

253
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,750
There is only one way to resolve this.

254
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,833
Agni Kai.

255
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,916
Someone's out there.

256
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,333
Let us through! Do you know who I am?

257
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,500
Of course we do.

258
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,750
Just as we all know
you're in defiance of my orders,

259
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,916
which means that by disrespecting me,
you're dishonoring your father,

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,500
which, I guess, shouldn't be surprising,
given the stories I've heard.

261
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,750
We'll take the Avatar.

262
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,000
Over my dead body.

263
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,083
Tempting.

264
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,500
However…

265
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,583
The Yuyan Archers.

266
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,000
Ozai was gracious enough
to lend them to me.

267
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:28,125
It's said
they can shoot the wings off a glowfly

268
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,083
from a thousand paces.

269
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,208
I imagine…

270
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,500
this shouldn't be
much of a challenge for them.

271
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,041
Where will you take him?

272
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,625
Pohuai Stronghold for the night.

273
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,500
Then straight to Capital City.

274
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,375
I'm sure the Fire Lord
is eager to take possession of his prize.

275
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,583
He's been waiting a long time,
and I don't want him to be disappointed

276
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,708
any more than he already has been.

277
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,041
If we take the Eastern Pass,
we can make it to Pohuai by nightfall.

278
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,791
-Prince Zuko.
-Watch out for the Archers.

279
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,041
But Zhao will likely station them
by the Avatar--

280
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,333
Zuko!

281
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,041
Pohuai Stronghold is impenetrable.

282
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,958
Why do you think
Zhao told us he was going there?

283
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,958
He knows attacking it would be suicide.

284
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,583
Entire armies have tried and failed.

285
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,791
Not only that, but Pohuai lies
inside Fire Nation borders.

286
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,958
Going there would violate your banishment.

287
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,333
-I don't care!
-But Ozai does, and if he finds out--

288
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,416
-But the Avatar--
-He's lost!

289
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,625
For now.

290
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,791
Right now, Zhao has the upper hand.

291
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:04,375
But sooner or later, he'll make a mistake,
and that's when we can make our move.

292
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,666
Until then,

293
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
patience.

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,166
Make sure you get this.

295
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,291
The Fire Lord will wanna know
all the details of the Avatar's capture.

296
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,375
Make it clear
I spared no effort in securing him.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,083
And we should add a few thoughts
from the Avatar himself.

298
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,666
If not for the Fire Lord,
then for posterity.

299
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,166
Now,

300
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,916
Avatar,

301
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,125
had you heard of my name
before your capture,

302
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,625
or was this the first time?

303
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,708
Please. You have to let me go.

304
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,750
No, no. There are four guards, not three,

305
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:03,375
and both his hands
and his feet are shackled.

306
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,958
-Make sure you get it right.
-There are innocent lives at stake!

307
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,458
I can't let everyone down again.

308
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,791
Not again.

309
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,250
If I were you,

310
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,833
I'd be thinking less about my past

311
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,000
and more about my future.

312
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,041
It's not my future I'm worried about.

313
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:28,916
Really?

314
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,583
I mean, I'd worry a little.

315
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,416
Oh, you won't be killed.

316
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,250
If you die, you'll just be reborn.

317
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,833
We'd have to begin our search
for the Avatar all over again,

318
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,166
so… you'll live.

319
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,166
Though not well.

320
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,583
Well…

321
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,708
Blow all the hot air you want.
It won't change your fate.

322
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,708
What are you doing? Don't write that down.

323
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:24,125
We are the loyal sons
and daughters of fire,

324
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,000
the superior element.

325
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:33,000
Until now, only one thing
stood in our path to victory.

326
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,583
The Avatar.

327
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:41,458
And today, we've done something
no one has been able to do.

328
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:46,333
We have captured the Avatar!

329
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,916
This is just the first step.

330
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,750
There will be mighty battles to be fought.

331
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,375
But not tonight.

332
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,625
Tonight,

333
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:02,666
we will celebrate!

334
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:08,750
We will praise the glory
of the Fire Nation!

335
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,500
Whoa.

336
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,833
Did you get everything?

337
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,875
You know it.
As much wine as I could haul.

338
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,208
Gonna be some night, huh?

339
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,375
Let's hope there's less firespitting
than Ahn's birthday.

340
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,791
My eyebrows
only just grew back.

341
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,000
- All clear.
- Open gate!

342
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,958
Whoa.

343
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,916
He's got the goods.

344
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,708
Man, am I happy
to see your ugly butt.

345
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,250
Who's there?

346
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,333
Sound the alarm.

347
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,250
Who are you?

348
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,500
Right. Run now, talk later.

349
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,625
Make sure to include
the full transcript of my speech,

350
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,625
but change "loyal" to "faithful."

351
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,791
It sounds more personal.

352
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:11,083
Also, make sure the Great Sage
has everything he needs for his research.

353
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,083
Now, was that "loyal" or "faithful," sir?

354
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,958
The Avatar has escaped!

355
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,833
The Avatar's escaped!

356
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,375
- There! On the wall!
- Don't let him get to the gate!

357
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,333
The Avatar! Stop him!

358
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,541
Ah!

359
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,791
Hey! Here. Take this.

360
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,666
Hop on!

361
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,750
Ah!

362
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,041
Ah!

363
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,583
Ah!

364
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,500
Hold your fire!

365
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,583
I need the Avatar… alive.

366
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,458
What… what are you doing?

367
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,458
Open the gate!

368
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,833
Sir!

369
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:45,750
Do it!

370
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,291
Now!

371
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,250
Open gate!

372
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,333
Do you have a shot?

373
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,625
Take him out.

374
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,708
Kill the mercenary,

375
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,916
and recover the Avatar!

376
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:50,625
Now!

377
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,208
Where did they go?

378
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,458
Check over there!

379
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,291
Did you see anything?

380
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,750
Sir, footprints!

381
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,833
Over here!

382
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,708
I have a small boat nearby.

383
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,458
We can't go anywhere.
Not with those soldiers still out there.

384
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,375
This way!

385
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,875
You shouldn't try to move.

386
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,625
You're hurt.

387
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,041
-I'm trying to help.
-I don't need your help.

388
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:04,708
Fine.

389
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,500
Have it your way.

390
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,375
What?

391
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,375
Nothing.

392
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,083
Can I ask you something?

393
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,791
It might be a little personal.

394
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,791
Goat hair or rabbit?

395
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,625
Your calligraphy brush.
Goat hair or rabbit?

396
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:54,916
Your characters are so neat.
I mean, I could never get mine like that.

397
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,666
Monks used to say lemur droppings
were more legible than my brush strokes.

398
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:07,750
Look,

399
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,083
I know I shouldn't have
taken your notebook,

400
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,916
and I'm sorry.

401
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,958
It's been a lifesaver. Really.

402
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,625
You have information
on all the past Avatars

403
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,458
that no one else has.

404
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,625
All the Air Nomad monks, they're all gone.

405
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,541
So all I had was your notebook.

406
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,583
I can't tell you
how many nights I stayed up reading it.

407
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:35,833
You helped me a lot.

408
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,750
I mean, <i>it </i>helped me a lot.

409
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,333
Goat hair.

410
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,708
It's stiffer, more control.

411
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,833
My teachers
made me practice every morning.

412
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,416
I wasn't allowed to do fight training

413
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,750
until I had done 100 vertical strokes
and 100 horizontal.

414
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,875
Me too!

415
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,541
Except mine were for spiritual studies.

416
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:14,083
A lot of the time, when I was supposed
to be meditating, I was actually sleeping.

417
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,625
I always got caught.
Probably didn't help that I snored.

418
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,833
Those guys out there, they're Fire Nation.

419
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,458
Yes.

420
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,916
So they're on your side.
Why are you fighting them?

421
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,083
They're not on my side.

422
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,666
But they will be.
When I capture you and bring you back, I…

423
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,208
If I catch you, I can go home.

424
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,208
Then I can take my place
as the rightful heir to the Fire Lord.

425
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:57,125
And that's what you want?
To be the next Fire Lord?

426
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,500
Yes. Of course.
It's what everyone expects of me.

427
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:05,708
Gyatso.

428
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,750
He was my teacher.

429
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,291
He said we can't worry about
anyone else's expectations.

430
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,541
I know. It's not that easy.

431
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:20,791
I mean, I'm the Avatar,
and… it's what everyone expects of me.

432
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,958
All I do is worry about that.

433
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,000
Maybe you don't have to be
like the other Firebenders.

434
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,416
Maybe you could be better than them.

435
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,000
You know
what the Fire Lord is doing is wrong,

436
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,500
so you don't have to be like him.

437
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,500
You can show some compassion.

438
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:50,708
How dare you?

439
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,041
I'm the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.
I'll be the example for all Firebenders.

440
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,375
And my father is a <i>great </i>man.

441
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,291
Compassion?

442
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,250
Compassion is a sign of weakness.

443
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,708
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

444
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,916
I have a feeling
you've been hurt more than enough.

445
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,375
Prepare yourself.

446
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:37,833
Father?

447
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:42,500
But… I'm… I'm here to duel General Li.

448
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,791
You're here because you have no respect
for our military.

449
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,833
- That's not true.
- Really?

450
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:51,583
Even when they come up
with terrible plans?

451
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,583
My plans!

452
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:58,041
My strategy. My military.
That's what you have insulted.

453
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,125
Forgive me, Father.
I meant no disrespect.

454
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,041
- Rise.
- No! Please, Father.

455
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,166
Rise!

456
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,166
Brother!

457
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,375
Don't do this.

458
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,500
He's your son.

459
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,500
We'll see.

460
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,583
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko,

461
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,333
so you can learn some respect.

462
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,416
Is this everything? Give me everything.

463
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,458
Compassion is a sign of weakness.

464
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,333
The soldiers are gone,

465
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,833
so you should be able
to get back to your ship

466
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,125
without getting spotted.

467
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:33,625
You know the worst part
about being born a hundred years ago?

468
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,625
I miss my friends.

469
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,166
Like Kuzon.

470
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,625
He was the best.

471
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,833
And he was from the Fire Nation.

472
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,041
If we knew each other back then…

473
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,833
do you think we could have been friends?

474
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,666
You should turn in, sir. We'll keep watch.

475
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,708
Any sign of the prince,
we'll let you know.

476
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,791
Thank you, Lieutenant,
but I'll wait a little longer.

477
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,916
You're wrong, you know.

478
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,250
About him not caring.

479
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,833
If anything, Zuko cares too much,

480
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,583
especially about the people on this ship.

481
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:45,750
Of course, sir.

482
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,250
Lieutenant, have you ever wondered

483
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,250
how you and the others
were assigned this mission?

484
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:56,708
The doctor is creating
a special herbal balm just for you.

485
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,875
And the good news is,
he says your vision will be fine,

486
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:05,500
which means you have the good fortune
of continuing to bask in my beauty.

487
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,125
Now is not a good time.

488
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,458
-I wish to speak with my son.
-He's hurt.

489
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,833
-He'll recover.
-But he'll never heal.

490
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,666
The doctor says you'll recuperate quickly.

491
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,958
It's a sign your body is strong.
That's good.

492
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,791
Your spirit, however,

493
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,583
still needs strengthening.

494
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,041
You held back today.

495
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,291
Maybe you saw that as a sign of respect,
but it wasn't.

496
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,041
It was weakness.

497
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,125
You must purge that weakness out of you.

498
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,916
You must be willing to give up the weak
to make yourself strong.

499
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,875
That is what makes us the Fire Nation.

500
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,458
That is why we sacrifice
the 41st Division.

501
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,916
That is what you must do.

502
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,041
Sometimes the weak can become stronger.

503
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,875
Sometimes you just
have to give them a chance.

504
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:36,083
I have made a mistake.

505
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,541
I've sheltered you,
and it's made you soft like your mother.

506
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:46,458
Well, since you seem unable
to learn within the walls of this palace,

507
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:50,458
perhaps the demands of the world outside
will prove to be a better teacher.

508
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:57,625
You will leave here immediately,
and you are not to return

509
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,250
until…

510
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:06,875
until you have conquered the greatest
remaining threat to our nation's destiny.

511
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:13,375
You will find, capture,
and bring me the Avatar.

512
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,875
You are not to set a foot
within our borders

513
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,583
until this task is completed.

514
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,958
Under threat of the severest of penalties!

515
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,500
Ozai! You can't!

516
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,833
Brother, it's done.

517
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,291
Oh.

518
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:30,208
And since you're so concerned
with the 41st Division,

519
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,875
take them with you

520
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,000
as your crew.

521
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,333
The 41st?

522
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,833
We're the 41st.

523
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,125
And you're all alive
because of my nephew's sacrifice.

524
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,375
There's something out there.

525
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,291
It's him. Drop the lines!

526
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,125
- You're injured.
- I'm fine.

527
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,791
We should have someone look at it.

528
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,791
I've dealt with worse.

529
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm not going to ask you where you went,
but in the future, nephew,

530
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:38,208
I would appreciate it if you let me know
whether or not you're still alive.

531
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,791
There actually are a few of us
who care about…

532
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:45,041
about such things.

533
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,125
Attention!

534
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,166
Huh!

535
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:57,666
Our prince… has returned.

536
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,916
- Hup!
- Hup!

537
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,458
What's going on?

538
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,250
They must've missed you at music night.

539
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:02,291
<i>It's amazing how far we'll go</i>
<i>to hide our true selves from the world.</i>

540
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,541
<i>Perhaps it's because</i>
<i>we don't want people to know</i>

541
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,416
<i>how much they really mean to us…</i>

542
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:18,375
<i>…which is funny because the truth is,</i>
<i>we would do anything for them.</i>

543
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,625
<i>We'd travel incredible distances.</i>

544
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,958
<i>Risk our lives.</i>

545
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,166
<i>Even fight monsters.</i>

546
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,208
<i>But I suppose it can be scary</i>
<i>to admit you need people.</i>

547
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>Some might see that</i>
<i>as a weakness, a liability.</i>

548
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,166
- It's been so long.
- How do you feel?

549
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,208
<i>After all, what greater pain</i>
<i>is there than losing someone you love?</i>

550
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,250
<i>Or worse…</i>

551
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,375
Gyatso?

552
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:03,750
<i>…finding out someone you love</i>
<i>has left you behind.</i>

553
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,208
Can we talk about it when I get back?

554
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:13,000
Of course.

555
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,125
Once I save my friends,
we'll have more time.

556
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:35,333
<i>I guess that's why we feel the need</i>
<i>to hide away and protect ourselves.</i>

557
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,916
<i>So we put on a mask.</i>

558
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,625
<i>It's not hard to understand why.</i>

559
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,583
<i>What's hard is knowing that sometimes…</i>

560
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,625
<i>the mask is who you really are.</i>
