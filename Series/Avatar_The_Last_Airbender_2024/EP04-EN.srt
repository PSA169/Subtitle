1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,375
Hello?

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,208
Hello?

3
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,333
Anybody there?

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,166
There's been a mistake!
The fires weren't my fault!

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,458
And neither was the fight!

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,791
Save your voice.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,000
Earth Kingdom soldiers
aren't particularly tolerant,

8
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,416
even under the best of circumstances.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,875
And these are most definitely
not the best of circumstances.

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,208
General Iroh.

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,041
It's good to see you, young Avatar.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,166
And Zuko?

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,041
They capture him too?

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:50,083
I hope not. With any luck, he's probably
halfway back to his ship by now.

15
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,791
This is all his fault.

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,833
He started the fight
and left you behind and ran away.

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,708
I'm really starting to see
what kind of person he is.

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,041
I doubt that.

19
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,333
What do you think will happen to us?

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,291
I don't know.

21
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,000
But in my experience,

22
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,916
the Earthbenders aren't exactly kind
to their fallen foes.

23
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,625
Is it true?

24
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,291
Were you working with the enemy?

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,000
It's complicated.

26
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,416
No, it's not. It's a simple question.
Were you helping the Firebenders?

27
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,791
Yes.

28
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,916
Teo.

29
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,458
I was trying to protect you.

30
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,625
The Firebenders said
that they would kill us

31
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,416
and then they'd attack the city
if I didn't cooperate.

32
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,291
The only reason Omashu has been left alone
is because of whatever service I provided.

33
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,541
Service? Is that what you call
giving weapons to the enemy?

34
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,208
Weapons? No.
No, no, no, no, just minor designs.

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,875
Nothing of any value in war.

36
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,458
Anything can be turned into a weapon
in the wrong hands.

37
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,333
Especially with the Fire Nation.

38
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,625
Sokka.

39
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
You know what it means
to make hard choices.

40
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,708
Your father had to leave your family
to go to war,

41
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,541
leaving you, just a boy, in charge.

42
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,250
We do what we must

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,541
to survive.

44
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,125
We compromise

45
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,166
just enough to get by.

46
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,791
My father would've never done
what you did.

47
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,000
I found him.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,708
Aang's in prison.

49
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,041
Aang!

50
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:40,958
Hey, Aang!

51
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,291
Oh, hey, Bumi. How's training going?

52
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,625
I'm doing all right with my forms,
but shaping is hard.

53
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,875
What are you talking about?
Looks exactly like a sky bison.

54
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,958
It's supposed to be a badgermole.

55
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,541
You sure?

56
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,208
There's nothing like earthbending masonry.

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,500
No seams.

58
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,000
That's what makes their cities a wonder.

59
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:12,250
Awe-inspiring palaces,
gravity-defying towers.

60
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,500
Impenetrable prisons.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,333
I like the parts of Omashu
that aren't so depressing.

62
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,000
Hmm. Cities are like people.

63
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,916
They always have their dark sides.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,583
Seems pretty dark
on all the sides these days.

65
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,750
Yeah, what happened here
happened the world over.

66
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,750
That's what a century of war will do.

67
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,875
A war started by the Fire Nation.

68
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,208
- And a war the Fire Nation could end.
- Hmm.

69
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,416
If it were only that simple.

70
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:45,000
My brother, the Fire Lord,
sees things through only one lens,

71
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,750
victory or defeat.

72
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,958
Nothing else matters.

73
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Not even the loved ones
lost along the way.

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,666
That's why Zuko's
so hot to catch me?

75
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,750
So he can win this war for his dad?

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,625
Zuko's victory lies not in winning the war

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,375
but in winning his life back.

78
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,875
You could show him this isn't the way.
He'll listen to you.

79
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,958
I mean, he owes you that much.

80
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,583
On the contrary,

81
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,833
it is I who owe him.

82
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,750
Far more than I can ever repay.

83
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,041
Impossible!

84
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,250
Omashu's prison is deep in the heart
of the mountain surrounded by solid rock.

85
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,333
The only way in or out
is through the palace.

86
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,166
I'm sorry. The Avatar is lost.

87
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,875
We're not leaving Aang.

88
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,333
You can get us into the palace.

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,375
Not after today. I'm sorry. I can't.

90
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
What about the tunnels?

91
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,083
Tunnels?

92
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,375
The secret tunnels
hidden under the mountain.

93
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,750
It's said that the founders of the city
used them to meet without anyone knowing.

94
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,750
-A fairy tale.
-You told me you've seen them.

95
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,875
Unless that was a lie too.

96
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,625
Yes, there are tunnels,
but they're unstable.

97
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Those who go in never come out.

98
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,291
If you believe the tales,
vengeful spirits guard the passages.

99
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,375
So not just secret tunnels.

100
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,541
Secret haunted tunnels?

101
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,625
Even if I could figure out a way
to get them through the tunnels,

102
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,625
there's nothing
I can do about the palace guards.

103
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,500
We'll worry about that.
Just help us get inside.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,625
Where are you taking him?

105
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
To the Pit.

106
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,458
The Pit?

107
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,500
An Earth Kingdom labor camp
for prisoners of war.

108
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,166
No one who's been sent there
has ever been heard from again.

109
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,916
You… you're not as lucky.

110
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,166
You're going to see the king.

111
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,958
These maps don't make any sense.
This one says to travel east.

112
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,583
This one shows a path due south.

113
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,541
And this one… spirals straight up.

114
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,166
Um… hmm…

115
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,666
What is it?

116
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,541
It's my Fire Nation contact.

117
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,500
Tell him you'll meet him.

118
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,458
Then go to the Earth Kingdom generals
and let them know they can set a trap

119
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,958
to round up these spies.

120
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,250
No. No.
No, no, no, the Firebenders made it clear.

121
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Any resistance and they'll send
everything they've got at us.

122
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,083
Let them come.

123
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,375
The Avatar has returned to the world.

124
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,375
It's time to stop hiding.

125
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,875
It's time to fight.

126
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
Your Highness.

127
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,791
Hmm?

128
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,875
The prisoner you requested.

129
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,791
He was caught fighting,
destroying property.

130
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,875
Menacing the people.

131
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,375
And he's an Airbender.

132
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,500
Huh?

133
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,291
Lotus root, pine bark, dried jasmine.

134
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,916
Hmm?

135
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,333
Lotus root, pine bark, dried jasmine,

136
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,166
scalding hot water,
steeped for two minutes!

137
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:53,791
Tea?

138
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,541
Okay.

139
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,250
And you're wrong about him.

140
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,958
We witnessed the bending--

141
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,375
Wrong!

142
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,500
He is not just an Airbender.

143
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
He is the master of all four elements.

144
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,583
The savior of the world.

145
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,208
He is

146
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,250
the Avatar.

147
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,208
And he's very, very good at rock skipping.

148
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,416
Ooh.

149
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:24,791
Bumi?

150
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,750
Hello, Aang.

151
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,333
Bumi!

152
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,750
How are you still alive?

153
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,458
Uh, clean living, the right diet,
ooh, and luck.

154
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,458
Hard to say if it's good or bad luck.

155
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,458
But more importantly,
how are you still alive?

156
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,583
And still a child?

157
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,625
- It's a long story.
- Huh.

158
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,291
Ooh!

159
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,666
Ah.

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,625
Ah!

161
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,833
Pine bark?!

162
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,250
What idiot told you
to put pine bark in it?

163
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,458
You did.

164
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,791
Mmm.

165
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416
Throw him…

166
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,000
…a feast.

167
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,416
Jet.

168
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,625
You betrayed us.

169
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,291
Betrayed you?

170
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,250
I stopped you
from killing innocent people.

171
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,333
Innocent? Spies, traitors.
Is that who you wanted to save?

172
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,583
Not everyone out there is the enemy.

173
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,333
If you stand against us…

174
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,000
you are.

175
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,416
Life may be simple in the South Pole,

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,250
but here, you have to make hard decisions.

177
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
That's what it means to fight a war.

178
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,958
I thought you were on our side.

179
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,416
On my side.

180
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,583
Jet, you've forgotten
what you're fighting for.

181
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,541
You told me to remember my mother,
and I did.

182
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,708
I remembered she never wanted
bitterness to fill my heart.

183
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,291
That's how I know you've ended up
on the wrong side,

184
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,125
not fighting for anything you love.

185
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,875
You're fighting because of hate.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,333
Just like the Firebenders.

187
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,791
I am nothing like the Firebenders.

188
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,833
Goodbye, Jet.

189
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,958
Look at the power you have.
That's because of me.

190
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,083
That wasn't you.

191
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,958
That was me.

192
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,041
You!

193
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,041
You don't belong here.

194
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,458
Sir, I was assigned
prisoner transfer duty,

195
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,000
but I'm… well, I'm late.

196
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:02,458
And… and if my commander finds out…
I'm already in enough trouble this month.

197
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,541
The old Firebender was taken to the Pit.
The other one's still here.

198
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,166
Other one?

199
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,958
Yeah, the bald kid.
The king wanted to see him.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Well, you just gonna stand there?

201
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,041
What are you gonna do?

202
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:24,875
Hmm.

203
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,458
For your meal, I offer you two choices.

204
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,291
Short ribs from Kangaroo Island.

205
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,458
They practically jump into your mouth!

206
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,958
And the other, seaweed stew.

207
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,541
Heard it really "kelps"
with your complexion.

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,791
I'm good. That was a good one.

209
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,041
I'll take the stew.

210
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,958
Hmm?

211
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,333
I don't eat meat.

212
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,041
That's right. You don't.

213
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
Good choice.

214
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,500
Wait. Was this a test?

215
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,083
What? A test?

216
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,500
No. More like a… a game.

217
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,666
You always liked games, didn't you?

218
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,791
So, frozen in an iceberg
for a hundred years, huh?

219
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,083
That must've been… nice.

220
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,666
No, it was a nightmare.

221
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,583
Ah, come on.
How bad could it have been, huh?

222
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,500
The world is on fire, people are dying,

223
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,958
and you… you got to sleep through it all.

224
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,333
All the Airbenders were wiped out.

225
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,916
And I wasn't there to help them.

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,291
Oh, those monks were always a bit flighty.
Am I right?

227
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,958
Huh?

228
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,708
It was a tragedy.

229
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,000
And it might happen again,

230
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,250
which is why I need to get
to the Northern Water Tribe

231
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,125
as soon as possible,

232
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,291
which is why you need to let me go.

233
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,916
So I can save the Waterbenders.

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,833
Hmm.

235
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,333
Huh.

236
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,458
"Lettuce" leave.

237
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,250
Nah, da, da, da, da, da, da.

238
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,750
Bumi! This is important.

239
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't you care?

240
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,375
Care?

241
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,750
You dare tell me I should care?

242
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,375
Have you been fighting
the same fight for a century?

243
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,958
Have you watched
your whole world burn down around you?

244
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,625
Hmm?

245
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,708
Let me tell you something, Avatar.

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,625
You may be a hundred years old,

247
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:53,541
but you haven't lived for a hundred years,

248
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,833
especially not these hundred years.

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,041
You can't make me believe
you've lost hope.

250
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,291
Not you, Bumi.

251
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,583
Oh really?

252
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,833
Challenge accepted.

253
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,666
This can't be right.

254
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,708
This was the only opening
in the mountain.

255
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,541
Are you sure?

256
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,708
Listen.

257
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,583
Do you hear… music?

258
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,916

259
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:51,916

268
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,458
Yeah. That was all kinds of right.
So what are you doing here?

269
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,125
What are <i>we </i>doing here?
What are <i>you </i>doing here?

270
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,625
We're doing what we're doing.

271
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,000
Right, but… why are you doing it here?

272
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,375
Acoustics.

273
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,125
Best in Omashu.

274
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,416
Hear that?

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,875
Harmony. That's what we're all about.

276
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,291
Harmony, music, love.

277
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,833
If these guys are okay being here,
the tunnels probably aren't that bad.

278
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,458
Tunnels? Oh, no, these aren't the tunnels.

279
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,041
Those are the tunnels.

280
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,541
Yeah, I wouldn't go in there.

281
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,250
We don't have a choice.

282
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,791
We have to find our friend.

283
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,875
Well, in that case,

284
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,166
you should probably see this.

285
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,208
It's a tale of two lovers.

286
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,250
<i>Oma and Shu met on top of the mountain</i>
<i>that divided their two villages.</i>

287
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,958
<i>The villages were enemies,</i>
<i>so they couldn't be together,</i>

288
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,958
<i>but their love was strong,</i>
<i>so they found a way.</i>

289
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,541
<i>They learned earthbending</i>
<i>from the badgermoles,</i>

290
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,583
<i>becoming the first Earthbenders.</i>

291
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,791
<i>They built elaborate tunnels</i>
<i>so that they could meet secretly.</i>

292
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,375
<i>But one day, Oma didn't come.</i>

293
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>She'd been killed in an attack.</i>

294
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,375
<i>Devastated, Shu wielded</i>
<i>her earthbending power</i>

295
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,666
<i>to bring the villages to their knees.</i>

296
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,750
<i>She could've destroyed them all.</i>

297
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,708
<i>But instead, she declared the war over.</i>

298
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:36,208
<i>Both villages helped her build a new city</i>
<i>where they would live together in peace.</i>

299
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,291
<i>The great city was named Omashu</i>
<i>as a monument to their love.</i>

300
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,250
"Love is brightest in the dark."

301
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,916
Remember that,

302
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,750
especially if you're going to go
into the dark void

303
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,916
from which no living being ever returns.

305
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,916

306
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,458

They're doomed.

313
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,208
A full complement of Earthbenders
just for one old man.

314
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,833
I'm flattered.

315
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,583
- Hold!
- Hold here.

316
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,291
- Hold!
- Hold.

317
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,083
Just a precaution.

318
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,416
Many around these parts
would be very interested to know

319
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,166
that the famed Dragon of the West
is in their midst.

320
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,291
The Fire Nation general
who laid siege to Ba Sing Se for 600 days.

321
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,666
Someone might be tempted
to take matters into their own hands.

322
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,416
We can't let that happen, can we?

323
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,833
Now, is there anything I can do
to make your journey more comfortable?

324
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,416
I'm fine.

325
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,041
Thank you.

326
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,666
You sure?
Come on, don't hesitate to speak up.

327
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,875
It's a long ride to the Pit.

328
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,166
And I've got all the time in the world.

329
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,833
Very well, men. Mount up.

330
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,541
So you wanna go north.

331
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,166
North is…

332
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,375
…not good.

333
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,375
There's fire all over the north.

334
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,041
I don't have a choice.
It's where I need to go.

335
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,666
A word of advice. The direct path
is not always the best path.

336
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,333
You mean
I should take the route that doesn't?

337
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,458
It means you should be careful
where you step.

338
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,375
Ha!

339
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,125
Bumi, what is this?

340
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,375
Yah!

341
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,166
Bumi, what are you trying to prove?

342
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,791
Prove? Eh.

343
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:03,083
Maybe I'm trying to show you
there are no easy journeys for the Avatar.

344
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:08,000
Maybe I just wanted to play a game
like we did back in the old days.

345
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,791
And maybe I just wanted
a bite of rock candy.

346
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm coming, Uncle.

347
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,833
This way.

348
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,500
Is that what the map says?

349
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,375
Mmm, the map's unclear, but I got a hunch.

350
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,166
A hunch?

351
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,833
Yeah, a hunch. A feeling, an instinct.

352
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,458
You see that?

353
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,875
Put out your light.

354
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,041
Well, what do you know?

355
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,000
"Love is brightest in the dark."
Get it? It was a clue.

356
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,458
You have to let it get dark
so you can follow the light.

357
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,000
That's how you find the path.

358
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,750
The light of crystals?

359
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,625
These things are everywhere.

360
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,750
On the walls. On the floor.

361
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,958
-They're pretty random.
-It's a path.

362
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,833
It said "love is brightest in the dark,"
not "glowy rocks."

363
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,875
Poetic license.

364
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,125
Like the minstrel said,
love is the answer.

365
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,333
Love is all you need.
Love makes the world go round.

366
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,000
You're listening to the minstrels?

367
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:56,041
-Sokka, wait!
-Katara, what is your problem?

368
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,291
My problem is
you're not taking me seriously.

369
00:24:59,125 --> 00:24:59,958
This again.

370
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,791
-I'm not a little girl anymore.
-Yet you keep acting like one.

371
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,708
And you keep acting
like you know everything

372
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,666
when you couldn't even tell
that a traitor was flat out lying to you.

373
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,416
-Says the girl who fell for a terrorist!
-That's not what happened!

374
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,458
-You should've never talked to him!
-You don't get to tell me who to talk to!

375
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:16,250
-You don't get to ignore me!
-I can if you're being an idiot!

376
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,375
-Dad put me in charge!
-You're not Dad!

377
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,541
Dad!

378
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,416
Guess we're not in Wolf Cove anymore,
are we?

379
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:38,916
Guess not.

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,333
Imagine if Gran Gran could see us now.

381
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,166
Really could go
for some of her seal jerky.

382
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,708
Or her noodles.

383
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,041
With the hot broth.

384
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,333
We'll get some soon.

385
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,291
You really think so?

386
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:04,791
I don't know.

387
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:11,583
Come on.

388
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,458
We better get going.

389
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:20,541
Seal jerky. I never knew
how you could eat that stuff.

390
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,125
Bring him here. Bring him here.

391
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,625
Put a saddle on that one.

392
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,083
Firebenders don't need water, right?

393
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,375
You know, at Ba Sing Se,

394
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,458
the city had to ration fresh water
after the first year of the siege.

395
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,291
Being in the military,

396
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,750
we got special privileges.

397
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:04,958
My brother, though…

398
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,250
he had a soft heart.

399
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,250
He'd gather food and water
from his platoon

400
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,916
and give them to the children.

401
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,583
He was on watch
the night you torched the Eastern Wall.

402
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:28,541
By the time we put the fires out,
there was nothing left of him to bury.

403
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,041
He was 19.

404
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,791
All those lives lost.

405
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,125
All that fighting.

406
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,125
And Ba Sing Se still stands.

407
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,541
Was it worth it?

408
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,333
We were at war.

409
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,166
I was a soldier.

410
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,625
You were a butcher!

411
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:06,666
You know…

412
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I can still smell smoke
when I go to sleep at night.

413
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,000
It never really goes away.

414
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,250
War pushes us to the edge.

415
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,875
Some of us don't like what we find there.

416
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,458
Is that your pitiful way
of saying you're sorry for what you did?

417
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,958
I wasn't talking about me.

418
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,041
Sir.

419
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,208
Stay back.

420
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,583
Oh, it's true, isn't it?

421
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,375
You have no humanity.

422
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:22,166
You know nothing of loss.

423
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,541
Is it true he abandoned the siege?

424
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,875
Yes, after his son was killed.

425
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,625
So his son dies a hero,
and he'll be forever known as a coward.

426
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,250
Brother, take comfort in knowing
that Lu Ten will forever be hailed

427
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,166
as a champion of the Fire Nation.

428
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,958
Thank you, Ozai.

429
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,833
His sacrifice will be enshrined in legend.

430
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,250
Uncle,

431
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,041
what a great honor for you and for Lu Ten

432
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,041
to die in the service of the Fire Nation.

433
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,166
When my studies weren't going well
and Father was unhappy,

434
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,958
Lu Ten gave me this.

435
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:06,916
He had won it
for finishing first in his officer class.

436
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:14,708
He said it should belong
to someone destined to do great things.

437
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,208
It gave me strength.

438
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,375
Lu Ten never needed it

439
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,708
because he was
the strongest person I knew.

440
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,791
You're getting good at that.

441
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,208
Practice and some good instruction.

442
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,291
Yeah? From the scroll?

443
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,125
Yeah.

444
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,458
And Jet, he helped me through some things.

445
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:44,208
He lost family, just like us.

446
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:46,666
He knows how those memories
can hold you back.

447
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,666
He got me to see
that I'd only been thinking about

448
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,791
how Mom died and not how she lived.

449
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,875
Jet might have gone down the wrong path,
but he was pushed that way.

450
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,500
Just like Sai was.

451
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,375
You know, Sai told me
I should be an engineer.

452
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,958
That was my true calling.

453
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,083
- You believe that?
- I don't know.

454
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,125
But it was nice to hear someone tell me
I had something to offer the world.

455
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,291
Besides my superior fighting skills.

456
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,541
Sokka.

457
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,375
What I said about you and Dad…

458
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,416
Forget it.

459
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,791
You led the tribe and protected us
with nobody to help you.

460
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,958
Dad never had to bear
that kind of burden alone.

461
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,875
You had it harder than him.

462
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,458
Oh, that's not right.

463
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,208
The crystals were just crystals,
like I thought.

464
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,916
This shouldn't be here.
We were here before, but this wall wasn't.

465
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,250
How is that possible?

466
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,208
It's not.

467
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,583
Unless…

468
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,875
The tunnels are changing.

469
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:31,916
Ah, behind these doors
lies a fearsome challenge.

470
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,416
A true test of whether or not
you are prepared to be the Avatar.

471
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,666
-Bumi.
-Ah.

472
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,125
All these challenges, games, tests,
none of them make any sense.

473
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,666
Nothing has made sense in a hundred years.

474
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,208
This isn't who you are.

475
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,041
The Bumi I know is a fun-loving, happy kid

476
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,625
who loves to skip rocks
and always thinks about his friends.

477
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,541
Huh…

478
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,916
I believe that kid is still in there.

479
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:04,916
Very clever.

480
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,833
It's all about games with you,
isn't it, Avatar?

481
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,375
Who cares about responsibility?

482
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:15,875
Who cares about, oh, saving the world?

483
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:19,583
No. More fun to goof off. Am I right?

484
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,083
Well,

485
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:27,625
let's play one final game.

486
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,875
As promised,

487
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:53,541
one final game to play, Avatar.

488
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,041
The simplest one of all.

489
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,583
You versus me.

490
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,708
To the death.

491
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,000
This is crazy. How can tunnels change?

492
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,958
-I knew the crystals were wrong.
-Can we do I-told-you-so later?

493
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,916
Any chance I imagined that?

494
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Badgermole.

495
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,500
Ah!

496
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,375
Help him.

497
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:34,958
Huh?

498
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,541
Do it.

499
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,291
Do it!

500
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,708
We've all seen enough death.

501
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,041
That's what you get
for showing an Earthbender compassion.

502
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,041
Ah!

503
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,958
You're okay.

504
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,750
We need to go.

505
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,750
-I think you should rest--
-No time.

506
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,833
They'll send more soldiers soon.

507
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,916
We have to leave now.

508
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,916
Ah!

509
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:36,500
Katara!

510
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,541
Thanks.

511
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,333
Dead end.

512
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,791
Katara, I'm sorry.

513
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,166
I'm sorry too.

514
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,125
What's going on? Are we dead?

515
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,416
"Love is brightest in the dark."

516
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,583
It wasn't about the crystals.

517
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,000
That's not what guided Oma and Shu
through the mountain.

518
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,666
It's blind.

519
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,166
They don't navigate by sight
but by feeling.

520
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:50,458
They sense feelings and react to them.

521
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:54,083
Anger, fear, but mostly love.

522
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,500
"Love is brightest in the dark."

523
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,250
So they respond to love?

524
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,291
How do you think they do
with verbal commands?

525
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,125
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Badgermole.

526
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,750
We'd really appreciate it if you could
show us the way to the palace.

527
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,333
Please?

528
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,000
Uh…

529
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,375
Ah!

530
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:56,041
Please, Bumi! You don't have to do this!

531
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,500
Oh, but I do.

532
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,541
Some of us have to fight
even when we don't want to.

533
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,000
That's what it means to be in a war!

534
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,875
No!

535
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,291
Ah!

536
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,458
You'd have known about that
if you'd been around, but you weren't.

537
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,583
You left us.

538
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:29,541
You were the Avatar.

539
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,625
And you left us.

540
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,041
In this world, you can't rely on anyone,

541
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,250
even your friends.

542
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,375
Especially your friends.

543
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,208
Ah.

544
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,791
Well, as fun as this has been,

545
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,166
it's time for the games to end.

546
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,625
Ah!

547
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,375
Huh?

548
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,041
Bumi, I can't hold both of them. Help me!

549
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,083
Let it fall.

550
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,958
Let it fall, and you win.

551
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,000
-Bumi, this isn't a game!
-Yes, it is.

552
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:02,166
One that requires you
to make impossible choices.

553
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,291
Do I save this town or that?

554
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:09,291
Who gets the last of the food scraps?
The orphanage or the soldiers?

555
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,375
You have to make choices like that

556
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:16,750
day after day, year after year.

557
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:20,666
And that's just to save this one city.

558
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,541
You have to save the whole world.

559
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,916
Let it fall, Aang,

560
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,833
and learn what it means to be the Avatar.

561
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:31,583
No!

562
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,708
Then the world is doomed.

563
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,750
Sokka, get the king.

564
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,458
Huh?

565
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,791
Ah!

566
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,166
Aang, now!

567
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,166
Are you okay?

568
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,833
Well, kid, you sure know
how to bring the house down.

569
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,791
Cheater! You cheated!

570
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,375
You didn't do it on your own,

571
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:18,708
so you didn't learn anything at all.

572
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,000
You were wrong.

573
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,333
You can rely on your friends,

574
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,208
and that's the only way
I'm gonna save the world.

575
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,833
With my friends.

576
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,958
You think like a child.

577
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,000
Is that really so bad?

578
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,041
Huh?

579
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,750
Remember this?

580
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,416
I use it to call a friend.

581
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,291
That's what I'm gonna do now.

582
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,708
Call on an old friend.

583
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,208
You were right.

584
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,375
I wasn't here for the world. Or for you.

585
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,791
But I'm here now.

586
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,666
Your Highness,

587
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,666
we've called up the reinforcements.

588
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,958
And… and…
and you doubled the guards on the walls?

589
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,208
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Good. Tell them I'll be there soon.

590
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,291
Wait, what's going on?

591
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:42,208
Fire Nation forces are on the move.
They'll be here by dawn.

592
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:43,708
You're under attack?

593
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:47,708
We will be, but we will be ready.

594
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,750
Fortunately, a source tipped us off.

595
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,041
Sai?

596
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:57,416
The mechanist alerted the generals
to a network of spies in the city.

597
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,291
Helped us round them up.
Now, all of you get out of here.

598
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:06,625
The Avatar has places he has to be.
We can take care of ourselves.

599
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:10,500
It's time Omashu rejoined the war.

600
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:17,791
Oh, uh, but I do have
one more challenge for you.

601
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,458
My cabbages!

602
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,958
Ah.

603
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,833
It seems we are always
getting on or off boats.

604
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,666
Perhaps that is our lot in life,
Prince Zuko.

605
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,916
Ah, good. It's not too late.

606
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,333
- What are you doing here, Uncle?
- Same as you.

607
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:37,250
Getting ready to embark
on what is sure to be a memorable journey.

608
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,125
You wanna come with me?

609
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,666
I've come fully prepared.
All the tea I need.

610
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,791
I don't need a babysitter.

611
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,500
How about a friend?

612
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,750
My father made it very clear

613
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,458
that I'm not to return
until I find the Avatar…

614
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,416
which means

615
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:21,583
it could be a very long time
before we return home.

616
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:27,916
Home.

617
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,250
Everything I need is on this boat.

618
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,541
Like I said, all the tea I need, hmm?

619
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:07,250
What is it, Zuko?

620
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:09,583
Nothing.

621
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,958
Let's get you home.
