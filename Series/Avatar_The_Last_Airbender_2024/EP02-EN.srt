1
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,333
I'm sure it'll turn up.

2
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,000
You probably just misplaced it.

3
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,625
And keep in mind,
the notebook didn't find the Avatar.

4
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,750
You did.

5
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,500
Your notebook may have been useful
in collecting your thoughts,

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,375
but your unceasing effort
is what led you to the Avatar.

7
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,458
He ran!

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,125
The ultimate warrior!

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,000
-He's a coward!
-I don't know about that.

10
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,666
But it's clear that this Avatar

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,166
is not what you nor anyone else
would've expected.

12
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,458
We won't know until we find him.
And I will find him.

13
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,333
I'm still the heir to the throne.
That's gotta mean something,

14
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,250
even in this dustbin corner of the world.

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,416
It does.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,416
And in this case,

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,166
it is precisely because we are
in a more quiet part of the world

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,000
that we have an advantage.

19
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,625
How many places can there be
for an Avatar to hide?

20
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,625
Kyoshi Island is
only a few hours from here.

21
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,333
According to this,
Avatar Kyoshi was the fiercest of warriors

22
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,541
and a master of what they call
the Avatar State.

23
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,541
Maybe something in her shrine
will help me control my power before--

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,625
You kill someone?

25
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,291
Before it happens again.

26
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,291
- It's time to go home.
- What?

27
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,791
We did our part.
We saved him from the Firebenders.

28
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,833
Now it's time to go home. My duty…

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,208
Our duty is to protect the village,
like Dad told us to.

30
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,750
They can protect themselves.

31
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,666
Besides, what good is saving Wolf Cove
if we don't save the world?

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,833
Katara, do you hear what you're saying?
Save the world.

33
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,583
-Us.
-Why not?

34
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,541
If the world is gonna have any chance,
it's gonna need Aang.

35
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,416
And you're right.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,000
We do have a duty,
and it's to protect the Avatar.

37
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,291
Protect him? You wanna protect him?

38
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,000
The guy who nearly
blew us off the top of this mountain.

39
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,125
It's about more than just helping Aang.

40
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,416
Ever since he came into our lives,
things have changed for me.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,416
Before I met him, I couldn't bend
enough water to fill a thimble.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,041
And now look what I can do!
And that's after a single day!

43
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,541
Look around.

44
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,541
Look where we are now.

45
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,208
I don't know about you,
but I can't go back.

46
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,458
Katara, something's wrong with your bag.

47
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,583
Hey! That's our food.

48
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
What is that?

49
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,750
A winged lemur!

50
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,541
The sky used to be filled with them.

51
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,041
What's this?

52
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>My dear Katara.</i>

53
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,166
<i>This scroll has been passed down</i>
<i>among the Waterbenders of our tribe</i>

54
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,791
<i>for generations.</i>

55
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:55,958
<i>It contains everything you need to know</i>
<i>to begin your bending education.</i>

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,083
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>how hard it's been to keep this from you.</i>

57
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,416
<i>But with the Fire Nation</i>
<i>hunting for benders,</i>

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,416
<i>it was just too dangerous for you to have.</i>

59
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,166
<i>But now that you've gone out</i>
<i>into the world,</i>

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,791
<i>you should take what belongs to you.</i>

61
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,791
<i>You are a Waterbender.</i>

62
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,333
<i>That is who you have always been</i>
<i>and always will be.</i>

63
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,750
<i>Never forget that.</i>

64
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,208
See? This never would've happened
if we hadn't left home.

65
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,666
Fine. We'll go to Kyoshi Island
and see how it goes.

66
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,750
Aang, you ready to leave?

67
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,916
There's something I have to do first.

68
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,375
My whole life, you were there for me…

69
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,750
and I wasn't there for you.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,791
Goodbye, Gyatso.

71
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,125
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,208
You wanna join us, Momo?

73
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,625
Momo?

74
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,791
Yeah. He looks like a Momo, doesn't he?

75
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,791
- Just like how you look like a Sokka.
- Can't argue with that.

76
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,125
I bet you taste like chicken.

77
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,583
Zuko, you must try this. It's got…

78
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,833
-What's it got?
-Quailpole egg.

79
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,875
Quailpole egg. Very good for…

80
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,791
Vitality?

81
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,583
Vitality!

82
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,291
What are we doing here, Uncle?

83
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:45,458
This port houses the headquarters
of the regional Fire Nation commander.

84
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,416
It is a hub of local information.

85
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,166
If anything unusual
were to happen in the vicinity,

86
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,791
it would be reported here.

87
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,583
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,916
You wanna ask a Fire Nation commander
if they've seen the Avatar?

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,125
If word gets out, everyone in the world
will be looking for him.

90
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,666
I could lose everything.

91
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,583
Calm yourself, Prince Zuko.

92
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,791
One thing you must learn
is how to get what you want

93
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,458
without divulging your true intentions.

94
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,541
You must use your tact, your empathy.

95
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:21,250
But most importantly,
you need to have… sticky rice!

96
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,791
Uncle, there's no time for this.

97
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,125
There she is.

98
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,916
Giant, scary lady.

99
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,125
Oh.

100
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,375
Check this out.

101
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,875
Sokka,
should you just go in there?

102
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,791
Aang!

103
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,458
- Sokka!
- What? What's happening?

104
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,916
- Watch out!
- Hey!

105
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,541
Ah!

106
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,916
You are trespassing on sacred ground.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,583
Stop! You're making a mistake.
He's the Avatar!

108
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,750
Ridiculous. There would've been signs
if he was the Avatar.

109
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,375
I think that might be a sign.

110
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,708
It's been a long time
since we've had visitors,

111
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,250
and for good reason.

112
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,166
For a hundred years,

113
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,208
Kyoshi Island has remained safe
from the ravages of war

114
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,416
by keeping to ourselves.

115
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,833
We expect the outside world
to do the same.

116
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,958
We're not here to cause any trouble.

117
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,333
All I want is
to learn more about Avatar Kyoshi.

118
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,000
Isn't that what this place is about?
Keeping her memory alive?

119
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,583
- We're not a threat.
- Maybe not.

120
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:13,833
But the next visitors might be.
We can't start making exceptions.

121
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
We're not just any visitors.
He's the Avatar.

122
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,291
According to you
and a few reflections off a statue.

123
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,708
I know you're scared.
I don't know what life has been like here.

124
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,208
To be honest, I don't know
what life has been like anywhere.

125
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,500
I've been away for a while.

126
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,833
But where I'm from,

127
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,916
people help each other.

128
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,458
I know I don't belong here.

129
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,125
That's something
I've been feeling a lot lately.

130
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,875
But if you can help me,

131
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,041
if I can learn to be the Avatar,

132
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,541
maybe I could bring the place I knew,

133
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,833
a world where people were happier, back.

134
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,458
What harm is there
in letting him look through some books?

135
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,750
It's not about them.

136
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,666
It's about who else may come. I know.

137
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,625
But if he is the Avatar,
how can we turn our back on him?

138
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
Such a fierce warrior.

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,458
-And yet such a kind heart.
-Mother.

140
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:31,166
Suki, you're too young
to know that there are many in this world

141
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,000
who would take advantage
of that kind heart.

142
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,166
I'm not too young.
I just haven't seen the world.

143
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,916
I'm reminded that Kyoshi herself

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,208
often benefited from
the kindness of strangers.

145
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,666
And as the Avatar,

146
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,375
she believed in helping those
who could not help themselves.

147
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,875
So we will open our village to our guests

148
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,541
for 48 hours.

149
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,166
I trust that you will respect
the limits of our generosity.

150
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,416
I get it.
I know why you wanted us off your island.

151
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,125
I'd have done the same thing.

152
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,458
It's a big responsibility,
all these people's lives in your hands.

153
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,208
Personally, I take
that responsibility very seriously.

154
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,833
I, uh… I'm the guardian
of my village, too, so…

155
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,708
You?

156
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,958
Yep.

157
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,875
A guardian?

158
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,000
So how are you protecting your people
if you're here?

159
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,458
What? I'm not.

160
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,250
I mean, I am.

161
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,333
I may… I may not physically be there,
but still…

162
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,250
That is, I'm…

163
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,166
I have to save the world first.

164
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,208
Katara, how does it go again?

165
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,208
I'm protecting Aang,
so I'm protecting the village…

166
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,958
Hey! Hey! Um…

167
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:57,583
The point is we have a lot in common.
We're both warriors, right?

168
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,166
Before she died,

169
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,041
Avatar Kyoshi trained an elite force
in her image.

170
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,166
One ready to protect
not only our homes but our way of life.

171
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,958
That tradition has been passed down
through the generations,

172
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,208
and it is now my honor
to protect this community

173
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,625
and to uphold the values of the Avatar.

174
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,666
That is why I'm not just a warrior.

175
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,166
I'm a Kyoshi Warrior.

176
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,875
Where's your commander?

177
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,750
I need recent surveillance reports
right now.

178
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,291
-Excuse me?
-And maps.

179
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,750
Nautical maps.
The more detailed, the better.

180
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,541
And you are?

181
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,291
Prince Zuko.

182
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:46,250
What an honor to welcome
actual royalty to our humble base.

183
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,250
-What can I do for the crown prince?
-As I was saying, I need--

184
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,750
Please excuse my nephew.

185
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,750
We've been at sea a long time,

186
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,000
and our manners
have grown as rusty as our anchors.

187
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,166
General Iroh, no need to apologize,

188
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,250
and please forgive our lapses as well.

189
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,791
We don't get
many VIP visitors around here.

190
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:09,166
Much less the famed "Dragon of the West."

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,041
As my nephew was saying,

192
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,458
we are in search of maps
and surveillance reports.

193
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,916
We're hoping to track schools
of jumping shark squids.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,625
- Sh… shark squids?
- Mmm.

195
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,625
They're migrating this time of year.

196
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,291
Oh, they're delicious,
grilled with a touch of lemon.

197
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,458
Hmm.

198
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,458
Huh.

199
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,458
I see.

200
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,041
Anything I can do to help.

201
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,416
If you wouldn't mind
giving me until the morning,

202
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,958
we can track down what you need.

203
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
Very kind, Commander…

204
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,916
Zhao. Commander Zhao.

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,708
At your service.

206
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,916
Ah!

207
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
Someone needs to put a bell on you.

208
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,541
There's food in the village hall.

209
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,875
Amazing! You're a natural.

210
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
Well, these are just the easy forms.

211
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,583
Well, it's more
than you could do before, right?

212
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,750
You caught on quickly.
You're a real Waterbender, Katara.

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,666
You know, you should be practicing too.

214
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,333
The Avatar needs to master
all four elements.

215
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,416
Maybe later.

216
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,583
I can't imagine what it's like
knowing you'll have to save the world,

217
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,500
but avoiding practice doesn't mean
you'll avoid the responsibility.

218
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,333
I know.

219
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,541
It's just Gyatso used to be the one
who trained me.

220
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,166
I've never really trained
with anyone else.

221
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,000
It's okay.

222
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,125
We'll do this together.

223
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,041
We're not going anywhere.

224
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,250
Or you could just let me use you
for target practice.

225
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,333
Ah!

226
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,166
Not home cooking, but not bad.

227
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,583
Just try that again, drumstick.

228
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,958
Are you really an Airbender?

229
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,666
You gotta admit, he has a way with people.

230
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,583
He knows how to connect,

231
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,916
to get through to people
like he did last night.

232
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,291
That's his real power.
Connection. Building bridges.

233
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,333
That's how he's gonna be the Avatar.

234
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,583
Right. There goes the savior of the world.

235
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,250
Is this what it's like
to have people from the outside here?

236
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,125
You don't remember the days
when the war raged all around us,

237
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,416
and we lived in constant fear
of the Fire Nation.

238
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,291
There's a reason we've avoided that
all these years.

239
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
"Avoided."

240
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:46,416
We've avoided a lot of things
by living the way we do.

241
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,208
Be that as it may, we've stayed safe.

242
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
If not happy.

243
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,791
This boy, he may be entertaining,

244
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,291
but that doesn't mean he's not dangerous.

245
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,333
He's a threat.

246
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,291
And the sooner he and his friends
are off our island,

247
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,333
the better.

248
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,291
- The Avatar?
- Yes, sir.

249
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,916
He thinks he's found the Avatar?

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,291
According to his crew.

251
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,333
They claimed to have discovered him
at a small Water Tribe village.

252
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,416
Prince Zuko captured him
but then lost him.

253
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,833
If Zuko's looking to us for information,
it means he thinks he's still in the area.

254
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,666
Gather any reports of unusual sightings
in the last few days,

255
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,083
anything out of the ordinary,
no matter how small.

256
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,583
-And do it fast.
-Sir.

257
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,416
Oh.

258
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,125
Seriously? Bell. Think about it.

259
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,875
Made it myself.

260
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,666
It's, uh…
it's great in combat and hunting and…

261
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,791
Hunting?

262
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,166
Yeah, hunting. Yeah.

263
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,291
For tiger whales.

264
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,583
Yeah, that's, uh, dangerous, tiger whales.

265
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,333
Ferociously deadly tiger whales.

266
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,000
Um, I could run you through the basics
if you want.

267
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,625
Wow. Um…

268
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,750
That was pretty good.

269
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,541
Uh, that was… that was pretty good.

270
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,416
Us Southern Water Tribe warriors are
known more for our hand-to-hand fighting.

271
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,791
Oh, right now?

272
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,458
Okay.

273
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,708
Okay.

274
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,875
Enough!

275
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,208
Nothing. Nothing about the Avatar State
or any of her powers.

276
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,166
Nothing that can help me train.

277
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,250
So how am I supposed to figure out
how to save the world?

278
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,125
How do I stop the Fire Nation
from hurting more people?

279
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,833
Did you know she was an orphan?

280
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:44,833
Lived on the streets

281
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,333
until she was hired as a house girl
for the richest family on the island.

282
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,750
She was quiet and kind.
No one had a clue she'd become the Avatar.

283
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,833
Yeah, so how did she go from this…

284
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,333
to that?

285
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,083
"Only justice will bring peace."

286
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,291
I never wanted to fight,
and I'm afraid of hurting someone.

287
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,875
Back home, the other kids
used to say I was lucky

288
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,791
because I never really had to train.

289
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,250
But I did have to train.

290
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,250
<i>Not to develop my powers</i>
<i>but to keep them under control.</i>

291
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,250
I'm… I'm sorry!

292
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:38,625
No one said anything,
but I could tell they were scared of me.

293
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,500
Just like how you and Sokka were
when I went into the Avatar State.

294
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,416
What if nothing in here can help me?

295
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,958
What if I never learn
how to control my power?

296
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,791
How many people will I hurt?

297
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,458
But imagine what'll happen
if you don't even try.

298
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,166
Aang, you're not alone.

299
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,541
According to this,

300
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,000
all the previous Avatars
are incarnations of your past lives.

301
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,750
You are literally not alone.
The other Avatars are inside you.

302
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,875
You want someone to teach you,
you just need to figure out

303
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,166
how to connect to them.

304
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,500
The answers aren't inside here.

305
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,083
They're inside you.

306
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,500
What is it?

307
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,041
Zhao's boat.

308
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,666
It's gone.

309
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,708
Zhao?

310
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,416
He heard something
about a flying cow near Kyoshi Island,

311
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,583
so he set sail at dawn.

312
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,291
A flying cow?

313
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,958
He knows about the Avatar.
Somehow, he found out.

314
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,833
We have to get there before him.

315
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:54,750
Ha!

316
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,000
Za!

317
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,500
Za!

318
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,791
Za!

319
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,500
- Hmm!
- Za!

320
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,000
Za!

321
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,500
Za!

322
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,250
Stop!

323
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:23,916
Bow!

324
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,791
Dismissed.

325
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,500
Ha!

326
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,458
Ha!

327
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,583
Ho!

328
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,916
Huh!

329
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,291
Huh!

330
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,666
<i>The world needs the Avatar.</i>
<i>The world needs you, Aang.</i>

331
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,333
<i>But imagine what'll happen…</i>

332
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,916
<i>I'm scared of my power.</i>

333
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,375
<i>They're all gone.</i>

334
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,333
<i>When the world needed</i>
<i>the Avatar the most, he vanished. He ran…</i>

335
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,416
<i>I don't want power.</i>

336
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>Which is why you</i>
<i>will make a great Avatar.</i>

337
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,083
<i>Avatar Kyoshi, help me.</i>

338
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,875
Aang?

339
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,166
Aang!

340
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,375
It's about time.

341
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,291
Uh,

342
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:23,791
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,208
I didn't know how to reach you.

344
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,083
I didn't know I could reach you.

345
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,750
There's a lot you don't know.

346
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,500
Can't we go any faster?

347
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,708
We're at top speed.

348
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,583
Everything that can be done is being done.

349
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,333
You've waited three years.

350
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,375
You can wait a little longer.

351
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,458
Three years.

352
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,291
Three years.

353
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:05,791
There were times
I thought I'd never find the Avatar.

354
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:12,166
But it's almost worse
now that I know he's close…

355
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
because now the chance to go home is real.

356
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:23,333
Sometimes, hope can be a cruel thing.

357
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,625
Sir, we're approaching Kyoshi Island.

358
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,208
I think I'm getting the hang of-- Ah!

359
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,875
You need to turn your opponent's power
against them.

360
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,916
Reflect their strength.

361
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,041
Thanks. Um, you're a great teacher.

362
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,041
And you're an excellent student.

363
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:04,375
Though I'm sure you were helped
by your previous training.

364
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,208
You know, as your village's protector.

365
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,583
Right.

366
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,333
Right, "protector."

367
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:15,000
To be honest, where I'm from,
there's not much call for a real warrior.

368
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,791
I think you're a real warrior.

369
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,625
Not like you.
You… you're not even a bender,

370
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:30,750
and you're the fiercest fighter
I've ever met.

371
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,083
Not being a bender means
we have to be even better than benders.

372
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,083
We can't reshape mountains
and burn forests,

373
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,333
so we have to fight with what we have.

374
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,958
What matters is not the power inside.

375
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,125
It's the will and desire.

376
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,958
The heart.

377
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,625
The truth is, I envy you.

378
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,708
I've always wondered
what the world outside was like,

379
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,375
but I never had the courage to leave.

380
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,083
I've always wondered what I'd find.

381
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:15,833
Now I know.

382
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,833
-The bell!
-You hear it too?

383
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,958
-We have to go.
-Why? What's happening?

384
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,416
It's the town alarm. Someone's coming.

385
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,208
Aang!

386
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,750
Aang, you need to come back, now.

387
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,083
Where are you?

388
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,083
There are many dimensions
to being the Avatar.

389
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:57,541
You need to be a guardian,
a general, a mediator, a guide.

390
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,541
You must fill several roles,

391
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:03,250
and many of them
require unparalleled strength.

392
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,458
That's why I need to master
all the bending disciplines?

393
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:07,958
To become strong?

394
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,500
Yes. And to help you gain control
over the ultimate power.

395
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,125
The Avatar State is
the combination of all your past lives,

396
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,583
focusing their energy through you.

397
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,375
The Avatar State gives you
the strength of a thousand benders.

398
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,666
I've seen it.

399
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,666
It's dangerous.

400
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,500
If uncontrolled, yes,

401
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,000
but it can also be the ultimate weapon,
and it can save your life.

402
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,000
We're too late.
There's no way around Zhao's men.

403
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,166
He'll have made it to the village by now.

404
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,958
In Pai Sho, the first move
is not always the best.

405
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:49,291
Knowledge of your opponent,
knowing where he might go,

406
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,875
is more important than speed.

407
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,458
And so where there is one Avatar,
there may be another.

408
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,708
Such a lovely island.

409
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:16,541
And we welcome you to it, Commander.

410
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,375
Though we wish
we'd had some advanced notice.

411
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,291
We are quite unprepared for guests.

412
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,083
Funny. That's not what I'd heard.

413
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:29,333
I understand you had an unexpected visitor
just the other day.

414
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,958
You must be mistaken.

415
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,125
We like keeping to ourselves.

416
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,875
I've heard.

417
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:40,333
Yes, I've heard Kyoshi Island
has had an admirable history of staying,

418
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:44,416
shall we say, insignificant,

419
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,875
which is why there's been
no need for the Fire Nation

420
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,083
to get involved in your affairs.

421
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:56,916
I'd hate to see all that change
because of an outsider.

422
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,083
Commander, the way I see it,

423
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:04,333
you and your men
are the only outsiders here.

424
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,250
An unfortunate perspective.

425
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,791
You won't mind
if we take a look ourselves?

426
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,625
I expected as much.

427
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,750
Take them, and find the Avatar!

428
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,708
You wanna know
what is the Avatar? I can't tell you that.

429
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,875
Every Avatar is different.

430
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,625
We are shaped by the different demands
of our times.

431
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,208
So I have to figure this out myself?

432
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,583
That is part of the journey.

433
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,791
But what if I hurt someone along the way?

434
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:15,083
And how many have already been hurt
because you haven't been here?

435
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:20,708
Run away from your responsibilities again,
and even more will be hurt!

436
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:24,000
Being the Avatar
means putting your duties above all else.

437
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,625
Even your life!

438
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,333
I was like you once.

439
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,416
But then I saw what was at stake,

440
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,083
and I will show you
what will happen if you fail.

441
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:44,208
Tragedy awaits the North,
and unless you do something about it,

442
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:47,458
another race of benders will be wiped out
just as the Air Nomads were.

443
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,125
You asked me
what it means to be the Avatar.

444
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,791
It means being a warrior.

445
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:57,958
A mighty, merciless warrior.

446
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:02,916
Ah!

447
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,916
Ah!

448
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,083
They're bringing more men.

449
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,750
- We can't hold them off much longer.
- Where's your friend?

450
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,375
You said he could help us.

451
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,541
Where is the Avatar?

452
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,666
What if I do what you say,
and it all just becomes worse?

453
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,750
It will.

454
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,583
Your very presence in this world
will make things worse.

455
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:13,708
At first, both sides will fight harder
because the Avatar has returned.

456
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,333
Hope does not come without a cost.

457
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,583
You. I'm getting through
one way or another.

458
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,958
What happens to you is your choice.

459
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,958
- So what's the point?
- You want things to be easy?

460
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,916
None of this will be easy.

461
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,916
Avoid your duties any longer,

462
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,833
and not only will you fail
to save the world,

463
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:36,500
you won't even be able
to save this island.

464
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,166
This island? From what?

465
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,000
From the danger
you've put them in right now.

466
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,083
My friends.

467
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:54,875
Ha!

468
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,916
I warned you!

469
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:16,083
No one's going to stand in my way!

470
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,208
You wanted to know about
the power of the Avatar.

471
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,333
I will show you what that power can do.

472
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,875
Impossible.

473
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,000
No, no, no, no!

474
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,916
Pull back.

475
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,250
Back to the ship!

476
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,041
Aang!

477
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,416
I'm okay.

478
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,625
This is all my fault.

479
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,291
-I brought this here.
-Which is why you have to go.

480
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,583
-Now.
-We can't just leave you.

481
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,916
They want the Avatar, not us.

482
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,291
There's nothing here that we've lost
that can't be replaced,

483
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:48,041
and you've given us
something far more valuable in return.

484
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,291
A reason to believe again

485
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,250
in our village, in ourselves…

486
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,458
and in the Avatar.

487
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,541
Nice job, Avatar.

488
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,250
Listen, I, uh… I wish…

489
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,166
we had more time.

490
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,083
I know.

491
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,041
I do too.

492
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,208
Thank you, Sokka.

493
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,833
For what?

494
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,625
For bringing the world to me.

495
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,041
Bye!

496
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,833
So this means
you don't wanna go home anymore?

497
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,333
And let you guys have all the fun?

498
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:38,041
Besides, someone's gotta help the kid.
This could get tough for him.

499
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:42,208
Zuko clearly isn't going to give up,
and he's dangerous.

500
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:44,833
Hey!

501
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,375
Nifty trick you pulled back there,
channeling scary lady.

502
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,208
This mean we'll see more of her?

503
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,375
Kyoshi said I can only call upon
one of the past Avatars

504
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,666
when I'm in their shrines.

505
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,291
What else did she tell you?

506
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,041
We must get to the Northern Water Tribe

507
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,500
because something terrible
is going to happen there.

508
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,291
Something only I can stop.

509
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,291
All right, North it is, then.

510
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,208
We just gotta get there
before the Firebenders catch up to us.

511
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:14,083
Waterbending masters there are the best
in the world. They can train you.

512
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,541
So don't worry, kid.
You don't have to do this alone.

513
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:20,666
You have me, Katara,
and a flying ball of fur.

514
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,875
What more do you need?

515
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,833
Really?

516
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,291
Feel like I walked into that one.

517
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,333
I was simply responding to reports
of a disturbance on Kyoshi.

518
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,250
I had no idea the Avatar would be there.

519
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,333
If Your Highness
had been more forthcoming earlier,

520
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,791
we might have avoided
this misunderstanding.

521
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,000
I hope we can put this behind us.

522
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,125
Of course, Commander.

523
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,125
Don't tell anyone.

524
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,208
About the Avatar.

525
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,875
No one else can know.

526
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,416
But of course.

527
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:09,166
I fully understand
the sensitive nature of this information.

528
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,583
And if you'll permit me, working together,

529
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:19,000
we'd be able to devote
twice as many resources to the hunt.

530
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:23,375
Obviously, with Your Highness
taking the lead in all matters--

531
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,041
-Wait, we don't--
-An excellent suggestion, Commander.

532
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:30,833
We would be honored
to have your partnership and your loyalty.

533
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,750
Believe me, there's nothing more important

534
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,875
than knowing where to place my loyalties.

535
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,375
<i>To Your Supreme Eminence,</i>
<i>the great flame of the world,</i>

536
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,166
<i>I am but a humble servant</i>
<i>in the Southern Seas.</i>

537
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:55,333
<i>But I have news for you</i>
<i>of a critical nature.</i>

538
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,791
<i>I know this information</i>
<i>may arrive as a shock,</i>

539
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:03,583
<i>and you might be tempted to dismiss it</i>
<i>as rumor or delusion,</i>

540
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,500
<i>but rest assured,</i>

541
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,416
<i>I have witnessed these events</i>
<i>with my very eyes.</i>

542
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,916
<i>That is why</i>
<i>I can report an astounding development.</i>

543
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,291
<i>One that could</i>
<i>change the future of the Fire Nation.</i>

544
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,541
The Avatar has returned.
