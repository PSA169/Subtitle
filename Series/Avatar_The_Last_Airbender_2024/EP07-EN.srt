1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,958
Prince Zuko, the Imperial Guard, they're
coming to take the prince into custody.

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,333
-What?
-The Imperial Guard?

3
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,291
-They're already on their way.
-Lieutenant Jee, slow down.

4
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:36,041
I was just on Admiral Zhao's ship
going over the latest… fuel usage figures.

5
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,791
<i>Lieutenant Dang and I</i>
<i>were burning the midnight oil.</i>

6
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,875
So funny, your face. Oh!

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,583
<i>Dang stepped out to take a message.</i>

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,666
Keep drinking.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,333
<i>I overheard them discussing new orders.</i>
<i>Orders from the Fire Lord himself.</i>

10
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>He sent his personal guard</i>
<i>to bring Prince Zuko back to Capital City,</i>

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,541
<i>where he is to stand trial…</i>

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,750
For treason.

13
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,916
- Treason?
- Are you certain?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,750
Yes, sir. I heard Dang
order his men to shore to meet the guard.

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,166
Tonight? That means
he'll be here any minute.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,500
This is Zhao's doing.

17
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,416
Somehow, he's convinced Ozai
you've turned against him.

18
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,875
Pohuai, Zhao’s figured out
you were the one that freed the Avatar.

19
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,291
Prince Zuko, you need to leave, now.

20
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,958
Do not start the engines
until you are well clear.

21
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,083
Stay off the main roads,
and travel only at night.

22
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,625
Uncle, we can't let my father believe
I've turned against him.

23
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:38,083
I know, but first you must get to safety.
Let me sort things out with Ozai.

24
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,541
Thank you, Lieutenant Jee.

25
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,875
Stay safe, Your Highness.

26
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,000
<i>Jee had no idea.</i>

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,041
It was all too easy
to get him to take the bait.

28
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,916
What will you tell the Fire Lord
about his son?

29
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,875
I'll tell him the truth.

30
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:42,958
<i>That the prince chose to put his needs</i>
<i>over those of his countrymen.</i>

31
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,791
And that his son was a traitor.

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,666
Blasting jelly.

33
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,500
The prince!

34
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,083
Zuko.

35
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,666
Now I need to deliver my condolences
to General Iroh.

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,375
I'm sure he's been through
a terrible shock.

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,500
Zuko's on his own,

38
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,458
and he wasn't anything
like I thought he'd be.

39
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,958
He just seemed so alone.

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm shocked.

41
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,458
Sokka, Aang made a connection with him.

42
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,375
Right?

43
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,291
I just realized Zuko and I,
we both have a lot on our shoulders.

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:11,125
This whole time, I've been worried
that I don't know what I'm doing.

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
And the truth is, I don't.

46
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,583
I haven't learned
any of the other bending skills,

47
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,666
and I'll probably continue messing up,

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,041
but at least I'll be able to do it
with my friends by my side.

49
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,583
That's right. Team Avatar.

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,000
What is it, boy?

51
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,083
Look!

52
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,375
It's the Northern Water Tribe!

53
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,000
We did it. We finally made it.

54
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,250
They're here!

55
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,708
Avatar, welcome

56
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,416
to Agna Qel'a.

57
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:06,958
This is…

58
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,000
Beautiful.

59
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,583
It's perfect.

60
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,666
We've been expecting you.

61
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,541
- Mother!
- Your beast is in good hands.

62
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,875
My men will take him
to our buffalo yak stables,

63
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,458
which are in a heated grotto
with plenty of light and space.

64
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,875
Make sure he gets seaweed.

65
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,208
Lots of seaweed.

66
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,333
Of course.

67
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,625
Welcome. I'm Arnook,
chief of the Northern Water Tribe,

68
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,958
and I offer you our hospitalities
and our protection

69
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,791
in the name of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.

70
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,208
Thank you. You don't know how long
we've been looking forward to this.

71
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
I can't tell you
the joy it brings us to welcome

72
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,375
a long-lost brother and sister
from the South.

73
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,291
This is Master Pakku.
He is our senior waterbending master.

74
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,083
And this is my daughter, Princess Yue,
our tribe's spiritual leader.

75
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,791
There's something I need to tell you.
You're in danger.

76
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,875
Avatar Aang--

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,416
I know it sounds crazy,

78
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,750
but I've seen a vision,
and in it, the North is under attack.

79
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,833
We know.

80
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,958
Several days ago, our scouts picked up
a Fire Nation fleet steaming this way.

81
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,333
We've been keeping track of them
ever since.

82
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,625
We are grateful to have you with us.

83
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,958
With the power of the Avatar on our side,

84
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,541
we'll teach them a lesson
they won't soon forget.

85
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:41,833
Citizens, it is a great day for our city
as we welcome mighty allies,

86
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,500
and we shall celebrate their arrival
with a feast.

87
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,041
- Feast.
- The spirits have protected us…

88
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,458
-Stop staring.
-Huh?

89
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,125
I can't help it.
There's something about her.

90
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,916
-Have we met her before?
-No.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,541
Now quit it before they think
something's wrong with you.

92
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,666
More than there already is.

93
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:10,541
I swear, I will not rest
until I hunt down these villains.

94
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:15,458
Our enemies can't be allowed
to get away with such a brazen crime.

95
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,250
And I know where to start the hunt.

96
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,625
I know who did this.

97
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,291
It was Ozai.

98
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,541
Ozai's lost all shred of humanity.

99
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,625
He's become so obsessed
with conquering the world,

100
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,041
he cannot tolerate anyone
who would get in the way of this,

101
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,166
not even his own flesh and blood.

102
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,291
I see.

103
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,583
I sympathize.

104
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,208
It does make what I'm about to say

105
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,583
a bit awkward.

106
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,916
The Fire Lord

107
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,375
has given me the honor

108
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,166
of leading a great armada

109
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,583
with orders to conquer the North.

110
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,250
We know the Avatar is headed there,

111
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,458
to the last great Waterbender stronghold,

112
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,125
and so I am setting out to take it.

113
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,041
Forgive me, Admiral,

114
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:32,500
but you weren't the first to come to mind
for such a… prominent mission.

115
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,958
I admit
that I have little experience in battle.

116
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:42,083
Of course, that also means
that I have no track record of failure.

117
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,375
Unlike you.

118
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,583
Ah!

119
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,458
That's enough.

120
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,416
Enough!

121
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,500
The Fire Lord deems your performance

122
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,583
below average.

123
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,250
But I defeated him!

124
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,666
You should've finished him
at least two moves earlier.

125
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,416
Thus, you will undergo
another trial tomorrow.

126
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,333
You realize
he's playing games with you, right?

127
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,875
Didn't feel like a game
when that boulder was flying at my head.

128
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,375
Just saying your father already knows
you're the best.

129
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,333
He just doesn't want you to know that.

130
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,875
Let my father empty his prisons.

131
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,250
Send every bender he has at me.

132
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,416
I'll burn everyone in the world
until he admits the truth.

133
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,666
What truth?

134
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,583
That I'm the one.

135
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,166
Why don't you just go and talk to her?

136
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,458
And say what?
"Hey there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe."

137
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,500
She's just a girl.

138
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,750
She's a princess
and a spiritual leader.

139
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,041
She probably sleeps on a throne
and only eats dewdrops and sunshine.

140
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,875
No way.

141
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,000
Stewed sea prunes. My favorite.

142
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,041
Is it good? What's it taste like?

143
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,250
Like…

144
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,500
like home.

145
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,583
Katara?

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,041
I just wanna say thanks
for helping me get here.

147
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,208
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

148
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
A world I wouldn't have seen
if it wasn't for you.

149
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,166
So enjoying the food, are we?

150
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,750
It's delicious.

151
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,083
You say you were entirely self-taught.

152
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:19,291
Yes, I feel like I've come pretty far,
but I still have so much to learn.

153
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,958
That's why I couldn't wait to get here
to meet other Waterbenders

154
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,333
and especially esteemed masters like you.

155
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,583
It must've been difficult
to grow up cut off from other benders.

156
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,833
The Fire Nation's attacks
took so much from you.

157
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,000
From all of us.

158
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,291
The worst part was I…
I couldn't do anything about it.

159
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,416
What's important is you survived.

160
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,708
That is what we do.

161
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,625
Water is the element of change.

162
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,458
And we Waterbenders
have always adapted to the flow of life.

163
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,291
Tomorrow morning, go and find Yagoda.

164
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,291
She is one of our finest instructors,
and she can start you on your journey.

165
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,458
Thank you, Master Pakku.

166
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:25,625
How about some cloudberries?

167
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,375
Here you go.

168
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,708
Thank you.

169
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,125
You can help me finish this.

170
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,833
Come on. It's pretty good.

171
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,166
What do you think?

172
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,375
It's delicious.

173
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:21,666
When I was a kid, I used to hide out here
when my dad would meet with the elders.

174
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,041
He said he wanted me to see
how things worked in the tribe

175
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,750
because, someday,
it would be my responsibility.

176
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,750
Not very fun.

177
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:34,125
Hmm, so I'd hide out here with the grans
and make dessert.

178
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,458
You <i>are </i>just a girl.

179
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,875
Did you think I wasn't a girl?

180
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,833
No, no, no. I just figured
with you being a princess and all--

181
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,666
-That I was stuck up?
-Yeah. I mean, no.

182
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,500
I mean, that's what I thought,
but, no, you're ordinary.

183
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,791
Not ordinary,
because that wouldn't be good,

184
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,875
and I think
I should stop saying words now.

185
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,583
I get it.

186
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,291
I know out there I seem all…

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,541
but that's what they expect me to be.

188
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't get me wrong.
I love serving my community,

189
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,916
but every now and then,
I just have to go somewhere and…

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,875
Make dessert?

191
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:17,958
No, I get it.

192
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,250
You know, back home,
it was my duty to protect the village.

193
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,208
I took that seriously.

194
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,916
Katara would probably say too seriously,
but the thing was--

195
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,500
It's your responsibility.

196
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,041
Yeah.

197
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,583
Yeah, and if I didn't do it,

198
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,291
who knows what could've happened.

199
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,541
You know, I made a promise to my dad,
and I was gonna keep that no matter what.

200
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,625
But there are times it would've been nice
to not have to worry.

201
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
Times I wish I could be…

202
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,791
Just a boy?

203
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,416
Yeah.

204
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,500
How do I know you?

205
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,708
Princess Yue.

206
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,375
They're ready for the evening blessing.

207
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,250
Thank you, Hahn.

208
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,750
You didn't have to leave the feast.
One of the priests could've come.

209
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,083
It was no trouble at all.

210
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,666
Really.

211
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,291
Welcome to our ice wall.

212
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,916
It has withstood attacks
for over a century.

213
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,083
Chief Arnook, if you don't mind,

214
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,583
I'd love to talk to our brother
from the South. Some combat advice.

215
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,208
Me? You wanna ask me about fighting?

216
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,916
You have something none of us have.

217
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,500
Experience.

218
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,416
Tell me, Fire Nation armor. Is it metal?

219
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,208
The reference we have
has spikes on the shoulders.

220
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,458
Uh, no metal. Leather.

221
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
And, uh, they don't have
shoulder spikes anymore.

222
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,708
The rest of the platoon should hear this.
Would you mind coming to talk to them?

223
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,458
Um, sure.

224
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,458
Great.

225
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,250
Tell me, Avatar Aang,

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
what do you think is the best approach
to the coming battle?

227
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,166
Might I suggest
you lead the offensive front?

228
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,250
You could spearhead an attack--

229
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,791
Actually, airbending is primarily
a defensive discipline.

230
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,208
Our style is to evade and avoid conflict.

231
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,250
But you're not just an Airbender.

232
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,041
You're the Avatar.

233
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,791
Truth is, I haven't mastered
any other bending.

234
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,583
But that's why I came here,
hoping someone could teach me?

235
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,125
But we've heard stories
of how you've saved communities,

236
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,583
defeated the Fire Nation platoons,

237
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,458
even battled monsters.

238
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,375
How were you able to do all that?

239
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,666
My friends help me.

240
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,666
We work together.

241
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,166
It would've been wise
to have focused on your training

242
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,541
during your journey.

243
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,166
It seems we won't be able
to count on the Avatar.

244
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,416
Water is life.

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,083
Water allows life to flourish.

246
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,500
And to heal.

247
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,041
Master Pakku told me
we'd be having a special guest today.

248
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,333
Thank you for having me.

249
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,625
I'd heard stories of water healing,

250
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
but I didn't think
it was still being practiced.

251
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,791
Oh, yes, it's a vital part of our culture.

252
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,458
Would you like to try it?

253
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,666
Feel the flow of energy through the body.

254
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,250
Connect that flow
to the energy in yourself.

255
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,000
Healing…

256
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,208
is more than a physical process.

257
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,083
It's about empathy.

258
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:40,416
You must understand
what it means to feel pain.

259
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,208
Then take that pain away.

260
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,291
You are a natural.

261
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,916
Thanks.

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,291
I've gotten good
at picking things up quickly.

263
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,291
We had to think on our feet a lot.

264
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,750
Nothing to focus your mind
like a fireball coming at your head.

265
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,041
Which reminds me.
When do we get to fight training?

266
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,958
Excuse me?

267
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,791
I think my basic forms are pretty good,
but I could use help

268
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,125
with accuracy and increasing power.

269
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,375
I'm sorry, but women don't fight.

270
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,916
We use our skills to heal, not to harm.

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,583
I don't want to just heal.

272
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,208
Healing is a noble and sacred tradition.

273
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,791
The highest of callings.

274
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,916
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,083
It's just that… I think
my skills lie more in combat.

276
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,625
So if it's okay, I'd like to train
in fighting techniques.

277
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,166
In the Northern Water Tribe,
women aren't allowed to fight.

278
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,833
Aren't allowed?

279
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,708
That's not right.

280
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,041
But that is our way.

281
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,666
Understood.

282
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,625
They seem like a good group.

283
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,291
We've trained them as best we can,

284
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,250
but none of them know
what we're about to face.

285
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,250
None of them have seen real battle.

286
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,000
Hey, I'm sure they'll do great.

287
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,083
Especially with you leading them.

288
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,291
So…

289
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,291
Princess Yue.

290
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,916
She seems great.

291
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,375
Yue, she's dedicated, kind, generous.

292
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,625
She represents the highest ideals
of our tribe. She is the best of us.

293
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You like her.

294
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,708
Um…

295
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,708
The princess and I,

296
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,125
we were betrothed.

297
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,375
It was arranged by our parents when we
were children, but when she turned 16,

298
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,250
she broke it off,

299
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,291
which is her prerogative.

300
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,083
Wow.

301
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,291
But she never gave a reason why.

302
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,458
So

303
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,541
you would've gone through with it?

304
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,166
You would've married her?

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,791
Thank you for coming
to pay your respects to Avatar Kuruk.

306
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,666
I'm here to do
a little bit more than that.

307
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,750
I'm hoping Kuruk can help me
make a difference in this fight.

308
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,416
Is that a problem?

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's just been a long time
since anyone went to Kuruk for anything.

310
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,041
The truth is,
his memory has faded for most.

311
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,250
During his time as the Avatar,
Kuruk didn't engage much with the world.

312
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
Some say he became enamored
with the Spirit World

313
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,291
and spent most of his time there.

314
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,083
Unfortunately, that meant
he wasn't around much

315
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,583
to help us deal with our problems.

316
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,333
So he didn't do his job as the Avatar.

317
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,208
He let everyone down.

318
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,583
I believe there must be more to his story.

319
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,125
I hope you're right because I need help,

320
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:59,000
and he's the only one who could
possibly understand my situation.

321
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,833
Hello, Aang.

322
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,791
I see you made it to the North.

323
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,791
Yes, because
the Northern Water Tribe's in danger.

324
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,583
Avatar Kyoshi showed me a vision

325
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,166
of Agna Qel'a being destroyed
by the Fire Nation.

326
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,166
I need to stop that from happening.

327
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,458
You can't.

328
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,250
If she showed you
the North being destroyed,

329
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,000
then it will happen.

330
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,958
But the battle's outcome
is still uncertain.

331
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,833
Whether the Fire Nation prevails,

332
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,041
whether the Waterbenders survive,

333
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,958
all of that is up to you.

334
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,708
I'm just one kid.

335
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,208
No, you are the Avatar.

336
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,833
When I was at Kyoshi Island,

337
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,333
Avatar Kyoshi helped me unleash
these incredible energies.

338
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,583
The Avatar State.

339
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,625
Yes! She said it gave me the strength
of a thousand benders.

340
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,375
I can use that power to save the North.

341
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,500
But to gain control over it,

342
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,000
you need to first
master the other disciplines.

343
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,666
Except she was able to take control.

344
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,416
She could channel the power
through my body.

345
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,041
She was in control. You can do that.

346
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,375
That's not possible.

347
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,000
-Yes, it is. Kyoshi did it.
-I'm not Kyoshi.

348
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,250
-But you still could!
-No, I can't!

349
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,458
After I became the Avatar,

350
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,208
I discovered
dark spirits were on the verge

351
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,500
of crossing over into our realm
from the Spirit World.

352
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,708
I had to stop them,

353
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,833
so I spent my life fighting them.

354
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,250
The war I waged on the spirits

355
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,958
damaged my body and corrupted my soul.

356
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,416
In my condition,

357
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,083
I wouldn't be able
to control the Avatar State

358
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,833
any more than you could.

359
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,166
And despite all my sacrifices,

360
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,875
I still couldn't save the one
that mattered the most.

361
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,916
A predatory spirit came
to seek vengeance on me.

362
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,500
Ummi, my beloved,

363
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,333
paid the ultimate price.

364
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,333
<i>The spirit stole her face.</i>

365
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,291
- Koh.
- Listen to me, Aang.

366
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,500
The Avatar must walk alone,

367
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,666
or else the ones you love will suffer.

368
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,625
Oh, sorry. I was looking for Katara.

369
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,041
Oh.

370
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,000
I should get going.

371
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,041
Is something wrong?

372
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,416
No, I'm just

373
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,583
a little tired.

374
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:16,708
Mm. I guess you need to go
and "recombobulate."

375
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,833
I knew it! It was you!

376
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,583
- Yes.
- You're the fox!

377
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,666
Yes.

378
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,916
But how?

379
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:37,333
Not long after I was born,
I got very sick,

380
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,291
so my father pleaded with the spirits
to save my life,

381
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,708
and… a miracle happened.

382
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,791
The Moon Spirit answered his prayer

383
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,541
and imbued me with some of its essence
and restored my life.

384
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,458
That's the night my hair changed color.

385
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,916
So you're a spirit?

386
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,875
Part spirit, mostly human.

387
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:05,333
Being of both worlds has meant
that I can be a bridge between the two.

388
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,291
That's why I became a priestess,

389
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,208
is to help people connect
with their spirituality.

390
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,583
It also means I have the ability
to visit the Spirit World

391
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,250
in my dreams.

392
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,375
So you pop over there just for fun?

393
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,541
Wouldn't you?

394
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,791
It's magical.

395
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,583
Not quite the word I would use.

396
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,791
You didn't like it?

397
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,666
What's not to like?

398
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,166
Nearly being mauled by a spirit monster

399
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,208
or getting my face eaten by a predator
or reliving the most painful memories--

400
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,333
Painful?

401
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
It was nothing.

402
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,375
Never mind.

403
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't do that.

404
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,750
Don't make it less than what it is.

405
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,583
It was something that happened
when I was a kid.

406
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,583
I overheard my dad saying
he was disappointed in me.

407
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,208
That I wasn't cut out to be a warrior.

408
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,375
That he didn't believe in me.

409
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,916
Do you know what I remember about you
from the Spirit World?

410
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,208
You were worried about your friends.

411
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,083
You knew they were in trouble,
and you had to help them.

412
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,875
Your heart.

413
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,250
That's what sets you apart.

414
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,833
That's what makes you a warrior.

415
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,916
I have a feeling if your father
saw you now, he would agree.

416
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,583
I need to know something.

417
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,833
Why did you turn down Hahn?

418
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,958
Hahn is wonderful.

419
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,375
He is everything that a girl could want.

420
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,166
But he is not the boy of my dreams.

421
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,083
My friends mean everything to me.

422
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:09,208
I can't do this without them.
It's how I made it this far.

423
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,000
And with their help is how
I'll make it through this battle.

424
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,750
We're Team Avatar.

425
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,333
There is no Team Avatar.

426
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,291
There is only <i>the </i>Avatar.

427
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,333
Stop thinking about what <i>you </i>need,

428
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,208
and think about what's best for them.

429
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:31,125
Being the Avatar means
being the one who bears the burden.

430
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,333
…alone.

431
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,750
I made… a carving this out.

432
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,000
A bear!

433
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,083
Uh, actually, it's a fish.

434
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,458
See? It has a fin.

435
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,041
Oh.

436
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,541
Hey, so did you talk to Kuruk?

437
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,833
Was he able to help?

438
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,708
No, he couldn't help me.

439
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,041
I'm on my own.

440
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:04,500
Ah, Katara, how was your time with Yagoda?

441
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,375
Great, but I wanted to ask.

442
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,791
Where will I be stationed
during the battle?

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,416
Women aren't allowed in combat.
I thought you knew.

444
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,416
No, I didn't.
I wouldn't have accepted it if I did.

445
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,916
It's not a matter of accepting anything.
It's how things are done.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,625
It's stupid, and it's wrong.

447
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,291
This is not up for debate.

448
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,125
I've been fighting Firebenders
ever since I left home.

449
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,541
Can any of your men say that?

450
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,625
-Doesn't matter.
-Why not?

451
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,583
This isn't about them. It's about you.

452
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:35,333
You're not strong enough.
Women aren't strong enough.

453
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,291
You haven't been training and preparing
to lay down your life for everyone here.

454
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:46,208
And I'm not going to let what happened
to the Southern Tribe happen here.

455
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,416
They won't let me fight.

456
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,666
They've been stuck behind this wall
for so long,

457
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,916
they've become frozen in time.

458
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,625
Maybe we should talk to Yue.

459
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,250
-Or maybe--
-Maybe we should listen to them.

460
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,416
Maybe it's better if you didn't fight.

461
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,791
This battle, it'll be like
nothing we've ever faced before.

462
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,916
People are gonna get hurt and die.

463
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,875
I can't lose you and Sokka.

464
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,125
Aang, you're not gonna lose us.

465
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,500
But just the thought I could
is gonna hold me back.

466
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,666
These people need the Avatar.

467
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,166
And I can't be the Avatar with you around.

468
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,500
I wonder what they'll call me
when the news reaches Capital City.

469
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,833
I quite like "Zhao the Conqueror."
It should have some flair.

470
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,833
Admiral, if I understand
these battle plans,

471
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,416
you are attempting
a frontal assault on Agna Qel'a.

472
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,416
The city is surrounded
by impassable barriers on three sides.

473
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,833
Its front is protected by an ice wall.

474
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:32,875
What makes you think you can succeed
when so many others have failed?

475
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,416
Because I have something
none of the others had.

476
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:41,041
I have destiny on my side.

477
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,750
Despite what our propaganda
would have you believe,

478
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,041
the Waterbenders are neither weak
nor cowardly.

479
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:52,166
Underestimating them
will lead to tragic consequences.

480
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,250
That won't happen.

481
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:57,791
For one thing, the fleet has been
outfitted with new, deadlier weapons,

482
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,791
but… more importantly…

483
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,625
I have personally made arrangements

484
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,166
to ensure our victory.

485
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,458
What is that?

486
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,333
This…

487
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,625
this is destiny.

488
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,333
He's attacking the fortress head-on,
like a bull in heat.

489
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,750
There may be more,
but he's keeping it to himself.

490
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,541
I fear I've underestimated Zhao.
He's more dangerous than I thought.

491
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,583
Yeah, I figured that out

492
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:35,250
as I was swimming away
from the burning wreck of my boat.

493
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,208
We've almost reached the North.
Have you got a plan yet?

494
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,500
A plan?

495
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,375
The plan is to prove
my father wasn't wrong

496
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,083
to trust me with this mission.

497
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,750
The plan is to go in
and capture the Avatar once and for all.

498
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,250
The plan is to reclaim
what's rightfully mine!

499
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,500
So no plan?

500
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,291
I'm working on it, Uncle.

501
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,375
I'm still surprised by Zhao's boldness.

502
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,291
I'd have thought it beyond him.

503
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,458
It's almost as if
he's working with someone else.

504
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,125
<i>Someone much smarter.</i>

505
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,875
Choose your opponent.

506
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,125
No.

507
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,625
-You must select one--
-No, I'm done.

508
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:26,125
-Azula, stop playing games.
-I'm not the one playing games.

509
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,375
This is your last chance. Fight or fail.

510
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,083
No.

511
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,666
You dare!

512
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:18,916
Ha!

513
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,083
You wanna test me?

514
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,666
Set me loose.

515
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,875
Let me go into the world
and show you what I can really do.

516
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,750
I'm through playing games here.

517
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,708
Hmm.

518
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:51,666
Look, Pakku's an idiot.

519
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,666
It doesn't matter what other people think.

520
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,625
It doesn't matter if Dad didn't think
I'd be a great warrior,

521
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,750
but I can still be great in some way.

522
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,666
The point is, I get to decide,

523
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:08,750
just like you get to decide who you are.
Not Pakku or anyone else.

524
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,791
I'm gonna challenge Pakku to fight.

525
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,583
I know. He's a master.

526
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:18,958
He's probably gonna mop the floor with me,
but it doesn't matter.

527
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
All my life, I've held myself back,

528
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,875
and I'm not gonna let someone else
do it to me now.

529
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,541
Katara.

530
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,666
Remember at the Southern Air Temple
when you said we had to go with Aang?

531
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,250
That we had to help him save the world?

532
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,583
You were right.

533
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:42,916
If we hadn't gone with him,

534
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,041
I wouldn't have seen
how two kids from the Southern Water Tribe

535
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,625
can measure up to anyone.

536
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,833
Firebenders, Earthbenders,
spirit creatures,

537
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,291
even strapping,
young Northern Water Tribe Warriors--

538
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,791
Sokka, if you're trying to talk sense
into me, you're not doing a very good job.

539
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,375
Sense? Who's talking sense?

540
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,000
No, what I'm trying to tell you is…

541
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,541
go kick his ass.

542
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,041
- What's going on?
- I'm not going to fight you.

543
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,625
Because you're afraid of
what you might learn. That you're wrong.

544
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,541
Please.

545
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,708
Go back to the healing huts
with the other women.

546
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,500
Whoa!

547
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,458
Fine. You wanna learn how to fight?

548
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,458
Study closely.

549
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,000
Had enough?

550
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,750
Is that all you got?

551
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,041
I'll say this.

552
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,125
You're an excellent Waterbender.

553
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,875
But you still won't let me fight.

554
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,083
No.

555
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,666
No one's pushed
Master Pakku like that.

556
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,458
That was incredible.
Those ice disks. How did you do that?

557
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,666
Can you show me?

558
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,916
Well, I doubt anyone's gonna say
you're not strong enough now.

559
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,250
No, they'll just say I lost.

560
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,250
Did you?

561
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:35,291
You said you're afraid of losing us,
and that's why we can't stay by your side,

562
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,250
but it's my decision to fight,

563
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,125
not Pakku's and not yours.

564
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,666
Yeah. Do you think we came here
just to leave you on your own?

565
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,291
Silly Avatar.

566
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,625
I don't know if I can protect you.

567
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,875
You can't.

568
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:51,666
Yeah, and worrying about
who will or won't get hurt,

569
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,041
it's not just the Avatar
who has to deal with that.

570
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,000
That's what it means to be a family.

571
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,291
Kuruk, Roku, Kyoshi.

572
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,458
They all said
that I need to do this by myself.

573
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,500
The Avatar must bear the burden alone.

574
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,750
This is the past.

575
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,166
Now, only one person
can tell you the future.

576
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,750
The person who'll write
<i>The Legend of Aang</i>.

577
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,791
She means you. You got that, right?

578
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,583
Soot.

579
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,791
The Fire Nation's here.

580
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,125
Okay.

581
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,750
Time to fight.
