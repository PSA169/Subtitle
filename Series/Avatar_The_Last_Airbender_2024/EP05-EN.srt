1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,500
Run!

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,958
- Get them!
- How many are there?

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,666
Five? Six?

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
Maybe more!

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,291
Faster! This way!

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,375
After them!

7
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,375
Let's go! Let's go!

8
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,583
Hurry!

9
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,166
They're getting away!

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,083
Hurry!

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,375
- Get them!
- Go! Go!

12
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,583
Now we have them!

13
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,875
Over there!

14
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,458
Whoo!

15
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,625
Whoo-hoo!

16
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,708
So… ice discs? That's new!

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,625
It's something I saw the Earthbenders do.

18
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,500
Thought I'd try a Waterbender version.

19
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,791
Your bending has gotten really sharp.

20
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,250
I mean, you've been inventing new moves.

21
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,000
That's the mark of a skilled bender.

22
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,750
I have been feeling pretty confident,

23
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,625
but I've learned everything I can
from Gran Gran's scroll,

24
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,750
so what I really need is
to get to the Northern Water Tribe.

25
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,458
Waterbending masters there
will be able to take me to the next level.

26
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,291
We've been running into the Firebenders
a lot more often.

27
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,458
We're getting closer
to the Fire Nation border.

28
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,583
It was bound to happen,

29
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,041
even without
Sokka's tragic dating attempts.

30
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,833
Hey, how was I supposed to know
she was a Fire Nation soldier?

31
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,958
Look, we need to keep our guard up,

32
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,125
at least until we get to the North,
where the--

33
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,791
Aang?

34
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,791
Fire Nation.

35
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,958
Why would they do this?

36
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,041
Why do they do anything?

37
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,791
This is all my fault.

38
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,166
It's the Avatar's job
to protect the natural world.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,666
That's just as important as helping people
and fighting Firebenders.

40
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,500
How many more forests have died
because I wasn't here?

41
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,291
Because I don't know what I'm doing?

42
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,958
Gran Gran says… life is a cycle.

43
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,500
And out of death comes new life.

44
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,833
This will be a forest again.

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,041
That's what you should see.

46
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,250
Seeds for the future.

47
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,083
Not past mistakes.

48
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,500
Hey!

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,750
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

50
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,750
You lost?

51
00:04:58,958 --> 00:04:59,958
Uh,

52
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,583
my name's Sokka.

53
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,375
Rhymes with

54
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,625
"okka" and "wakka wakka."

55
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,416
She looks very brave. She have a name?

56
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,750
Well, maybe we can
come up with one for her.

57
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,791
How about

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,833
Pippinpaddle Oppsokopolis?

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,250
The third.

60
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,250
Shi-yong made her for me.

61
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,000
Shi-yong?

62
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,583
Is Shi-yong your friend, or is he…

63
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,208
Sokka!

64
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,166
No, wait.

65
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,458
Over there.

66
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:53,916
There you are.

67
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,041
You know better
than to wander off by yourself.

68
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey, she… she dropped this.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,708
We're not here to cause trouble. We…

70
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,083
She was just scared.

71
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,958
Something bad happened here, didn't it?

72
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
Please forgive my manners.

73
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,583
-Thank you for helping my daughter.
-No need to apologize.

74
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,875
Living this close to the Fire Nation
means you've gotta stay on your guard.

75
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,583
Yes. We have seen our share of war.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,541
Was that how the forest was destroyed?
A battle?

77
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,708
No.

78
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,583
The Firebenders just wanted a clear path
as they moved through the mountains.

79
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,583
And that's why
they burned down the forest?

80
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,375
But after the fire,
strange things started happening.

81
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,000
Our crops started dying.
Our… our animals stopped grazing.

82
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,291
It… it's almost as if the land itself
had gotten sick.

83
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,791
A few days ago, we sent out an expedition
to search for food.

84
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,625
And they never came back.

85
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,625
My son, Shi-yong,

86
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
he was with them.

87
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,708
We know what it is like to live in fear.

88
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,166
But this, this is something deeper.

89
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,708
It's something

90
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,166
beyond this world.

91
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,166
You're right.
Your people are beyond this world.

92
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,500
But I can get them back.

93
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,791
Any news?

94
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,250
No, sir.

95
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,750
Nothing?

96
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,833
How many places can there be
for a giant sky bison to hide?

97
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,583
-And no reports of anything unusual?
-None.

98
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:51,916
Except…

99
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,250
Except what?

100
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,416
One of the resupply merchants
mentioned something about

101
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,958
kids playing with ice blocks
near Senlin Pass,

102
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,750
but he was probably mistaken.

103
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,041
So someone saw ice

104
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,791
in a place where no ice should exist?

105
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:14,541
Most people would call that unusual,
wouldn't they, Lieutenant Jee?

106
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,333
Unless they were an idiot.

107
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,083
- I'll send some men to investigate.
- No, I'll have to do it myself.

108
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,208
As always.

109
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,375
Commander Zhao is very impressive…

110
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,916
working with no support
in a forgotten little corner of the world,

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,833
and yet he found the Avatar.

112
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,458
I've always admired
how you manage your commanders.

113
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,333
You always seem to know
how to get the most out of their talents.

114
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,208
Now,

115
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,791
if it were me,

116
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,166
I'd send more resources to Zhao.

117
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,541
See what he can do with a little support.

118
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,791
"Water the most promising seeds."

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,125
You taught me that.

120
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,375
You may be right.

121
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,291
Tell Colonel Shinu
to mobilize the archers.

122
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,500
And alert the chancellor
I'll be redirecting some funds.

123
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,583
And, Azula…

124
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,000
Zhao didn't discover the Avatar. Zuko did.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,875
He's the one who displayed
resilience and dedication.

126
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,750
That's what I expect from a future heir.

127
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,125
Not self-serving flattery
and coy whispers.

128
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,166
The world we live in
isn't the only world there is.

129
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
There's another realm beyond ours.

130
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,166
The Spirit World.

131
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,041
Usually, the two remain separate,

132
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,833
but there are places
where the barrier between them is thin.

133
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,666
So you think the forest
is one of these thin places?

134
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,916
I don't think it.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,041
I feel it.

136
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,208
And I believe the fires
weaken the barrier even more.

137
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,250
The Avatar is the bridge between
the natural world and the Spirit World,

138
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,541
and I can feel how close the two are.

139
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,875
It's like ice that's started to crack.

140
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:44,708
So you're gonna hop into the Spirit World,
grab the lost folks, and hop back.

141
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,333
Something like that. Yeah.

142
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,708
You sounded a lot more confident before.

143
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,166
Because all of this is my responsibility.

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,166
Yes, I need to get to the North
so I can save the Waterbenders,

145
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,041
but I also need to help these people

146
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
so they don't lose their homes
and the ones they love

147
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,791
the way I lost mine.

148
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,833
It's impossible for you to do everything.

149
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,458
It's like Bumi said,
"The Avatar has to do the impossible."

150
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,583
I need to find where
the spiritual energies are strongest.

151
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,458
And where's that?

152
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,541
I'll know it when I find it.

153
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,250
You almost said something specific.

154
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,125
Katara?

155
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,000
Aang?

156
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,958
A shrine
to the spirit of the forest.

157
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,541
This is the place.

158
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,791
So what do we do?

159
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,833
We watch over Aang.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,833
Once his spirit crosses over,
his body will be vulnerable.

161
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,208
We need to protect him.

162
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh.

163
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,166
And how will we know that this works?

164
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,041
I'm not sure.

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
-I'm getting hungry.
-Hey, do you mind?

166
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,166
I'm trying to concentrate here.

167
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
Sh.

168
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,875
Sh.

169
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,750
Sokka, I think it worked.

170
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,708
Katara?

171
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,500
Ah!

172
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,625
-What is happening?
-I don't know! Aang?

173
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:46,083
I've separated my spirit from my body,
but somehow, I brought you guys with me.

174
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,125
How is that possible?

175
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,958
Must be the energies in the place

176
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
and the thinness of the barrier
and my power.

177
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,041
Well, get us back! Get us back now!

178
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
I'm… I'm sorry.

179
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,583
Uh…

180
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,791
We're in the Spirit World.

181
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,833
Don't mention the Avatar.
We can't let word get out.

182
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,791
Agreed. And we should tread lightly.

183
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
The Fire Nation
may control this territory,

184
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,875
but it's still Earthbender country.

185
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,208
-We don't want to cause trouble.
-When have I ever caused trouble?

186
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,916
When, indeed.

187
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,708
They're Fire Nation. Look at them.

188
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,041
Look at their garments.

189
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,875
I heard Waterbenders might've been
around these parts not long ago.

190
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,541
-Did you see them?
-No.

191
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,291
-But you remember hearing about them.
-Sort of.

192
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,041
Perhaps this… will help.

193
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,750
Now,

194
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,000
did you see the Waterbenders?

195
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,125
No.

196
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,000
But I heard the Avatar might be traveling
with some Waterbenders.

197
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,916
- What did you say?
- The Avatar.

198
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,708
He's with some Waterbenders.

199
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,250
Isn't that right, Muki?

200
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,833
What? The Avatar?
That's what those pirates said.

201
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,750
No, it wasn't the pirates.
It was that canyon guide.

202
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,375
He said the Avatar
fought off some canyon crawlers

203
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,250
with the help of a couple Waterbenders.

204
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,125
Was he the one who told us about
how they stopped the volcano…

205
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,041
It seems they've heard about the Avatar.

206
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,833
Right after they fought
the mad King of Omashu.

207
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,083
I'm gonna lose him.
I'm gonna lose everything!

208
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,375
If word has gotten to this backwoods hole,
that means everyone knows.

209
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,250
Everyone in the Earth Kingdom.
Everyone in the Fire Nation.

210
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,208
The hunters will be out.
There's blood in the water now.

211
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,208
Help me! She's crazy!

212
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,625
Don't die, you idiot.

213
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,166
I only get half if you die.

214
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,666
What are you looking at?

215
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,583
A low-life bounty hunter.

216
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,625
Low-life? Big talk for a little boy.

217
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,083
I'll let it pass
'cause your dad's kinda cute.

218
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,958
Should've known they would've let
mercenaries run wild here.

219
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,708
Gyatso used to tell me that
the Spirit World and the physical world

220
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,791
are tied together.

221
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,166
What happens to one affects the other.
It's kinda like your soul and your body.

222
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,208
Separate but connected.

223
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,333
That makes sense.

224
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,250
Gyatso had a way
of making things easy to understand.

225
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,541
He made everything easy.

226
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,375
He sounds amazing.

227
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,000
He was.

228
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,250
You know, I've always felt
I was a spiritually-attuned person.

229
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
-Might be why I crossed over with you.
-Is that a frog or a froggy thing?

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I have no idea how he got in here.

231
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,458
The villagers are probably trying
to find a way out.

232
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,958
They're probably looking
for something familiar.

233
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,625
Assuming they realize
they don't belong in here.

234
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,208
None of you belong in here.

235
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,958
Uh, who said that?

236
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,541
Who said what?

237
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,958
No human belongs in this realm.

238
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,250
That is one big birdie.

239
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,500
"Birdie"?

240
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,375
I am no birdie.

241
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:25,083
I am the spirit of knowledge itself.

242
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,208
Please excuse Sokka.
He didn't mean anything.

243
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,958
-Aang, who are you talking to?
-What do you mean?

244
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,500
They do not hear what you hear.

245
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,333
Their small minds are incapable
of comprehending my speech.

246
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,791
But I hear you.

247
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,500
You are the Avatar.

248
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,250
You were meant
to have one foot in this world.

249
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,083
They, however, are interlopers.

250
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,583
And the longer they stay,

251
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,833
the more dangerous
it will become for them.

252
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,750
Dangerous?

253
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,291
Dangerous?

254
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,333
The birdie's not gonna eat us, is it?

255
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,000
That should be the least of his worries.

256
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,791
There are creatures in here
that will do far more

257
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,791
than devour your body.

258
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,166
They'll eat your soul.

259
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
Aang? What's he saying?

260
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,625
He says he's not gonna hurt us.

261
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,208
All we want is
to find our missing friends,

262
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,541
and we'll get out of here.

263
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:27,125
There is one who lives in a stone hut
not far beyond the woods.

264
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,583
He may know what's become of your friends.

265
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,000
Follow the path, and you will find him.

266
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,500
Wait. Wait.
What did you mean about danger?

267
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,125
What could happen to them?

268
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,750
There are things in here
that will reveal truths to humans.

269
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,916
Truths they're never prepared to face.

270
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,916
It will show them who they really are,

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,416
and that can cause a great deal of pain.

272
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,125
Farewell, Avatar,

273
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,333
and remember, stay on the path.

274
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,333
Bye-bye, Birdie.

275
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,708
That's enough.

276
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,291
The lesson is over, Your Highness.

277
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,375
Azula!

278
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,666
Azula!

279
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,916
Azula!

280
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,750
Are you okay?
Here, let me help you.

281
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,416
Um,

282
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
that was intense.

283
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,666
Yeah.

284
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,833
-You could've hurt him.
-That's his fault.

285
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,458
He should've been better.

286
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,416
Except this wasn't about the trainer…
was it?

287
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Azula, you're the best.

288
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,291
Everybody knows that.

289
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,500
You're perfect.

290
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,750
That's not good enough.

291
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,458
There you are. Where have you been?

292
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,125
Apologies. I got distracted
watching a game of Pai Sho.

293
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,333
The street players in these parts
are quite good.

294
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,916
I'm sure they are. Now let's go.

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,250
They didn't follow the expected tactics,
but that was their strength.

296
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,250
Uncle, is there any chance
you could finish this story on the boat?

297
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,083
Prince Zuko, there is much you can learn
from these Pai Sho players.

298
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:28,500
They are untrained, but that only means
their minds are open to new ideas.

299
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,208
And so they are ready
when a solution reveals itself.

300
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,375
No!

301
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,416
June is the best at what she does,
and that's finding people.

302
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,250
She's a mercenary.
Her loyalty is bought and sold.

303
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,000
How can you trust someone like that?

304
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,916
June is a professional.

305
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,916
If she fails, she doesn't get paid,
and she doesn't eat.

306
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,708
Prince Zuko,
I know you have always believed

307
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,958
there is a right and a wrong way
of doing things.

308
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,916
It is a mark of a great leader,

309
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,333
but the rules are different out here.

310
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,000
Commander Zhao knows this,

311
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:19,291
and he's already making moves
while we have yet to draw our tiles.

312
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,625
So… tell me about this Avatar.

313
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,166
Um…

314
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,250
-Oh, did you see that?
-See what?

315
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,666
Did you see… that?

316
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,333
Sokka, relax.

317
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,208
The owl said we'd be fine
as long as we stuck to the path.

318
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,208
Right, Aang?

319
00:22:59,125 --> 00:22:59,958
Right.

320
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,750
Aang? What did the owl really say?

321
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,000
He said it could be dangerous
for you guys in here.

322
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,500
That you might have to face the truth.

323
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:17,208
But how bad could the truth be, right?

324
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,500
Right.

325
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,083
Right?

326
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,166
The truth.

327
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,125
Yeah.

328
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,583
Yeah, I can deal with the truth.

329
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,916
What I can't deal with is getting eaten
by some giant spirit monster.

330
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,791
You had to say something.

331
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,541
Aang, please tell me that's some
spirit language only you can understand,

332
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,666
and it's saying, "Welcome, friends,
would you like some cake?"

333
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,416
That's not what it's saying.

334
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,166
Just stay on the path.

335
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,416
The owl said it'd be okay
as long as we stay on the path.

336
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,291
We're on the path. We're on the path.

337
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,125
We're on the path! We're on the path!

338
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,500
Get off the path!

339
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,958
It's the spirit of the forest.

340
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,041
It's wounded.

341
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,375
I can't bend. I can't bend!

342
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,416
I can't either.

343
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,416
Look out!

344
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:46,208
Hey, skunky! Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

345
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,458
I… I didn't mean me.

346
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,041
-Sokka!
-Everyone, run!

347
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,083
Pain.

348
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,333
Pain.

349
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,000
So much pain.

350
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,458
Actually, they're just scratches.

351
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,833
Not you. Hei Bai.

352
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,166
Hey, what?

353
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,416
Hei Bai. That spirit.

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,333
It's in a lot of pain.

355
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,458
I must've landed harder than I thought.

356
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,875
I'm a little discombobulated.

357
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,916
You're funny.

358
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,875
And you're a talking fox.

359
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,250
Then again,
not the craziest thing I've seen today.

360
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,583
I need to get to my friends
before they get eaten by that monster.

361
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,708
It's not a monster. It's hurt.

362
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,750
That's what pain does to you.

363
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,000
It changes you
into something that you're not.

364
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,375
Don't you know what it's like to be hurt?

365
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,833
Well, these scratches
are making me pretty irritable, so…

366
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:13,375
Do you always make jokes
when you don't wanna talk about something?

367
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,416
What? That's not what I do.

368
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:20,333
You should go.
I hope you can "recombobulate."

369
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,708
Spirit World.

370
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,333
Oh, and be careful.

371
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,625
The fog can be… dangerous.

372
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:37,750
Sokka?

373
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,000
Aang?

374
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,625
Aang?

375
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,291
Katara.

376
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,875
- Mom?
- There you are.

377
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,041
I've been looking all over for you.

378
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,750
This can't be.

379
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,250
- Is it really you?
- What?

380
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,583
Katara, are you okay?

381
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,000
It's just been so long.

382
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,125
Come on. We're late.

383
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,708
I'm telling you, four strands is stronger.

384
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,916
I didn't say it wasn't stronger.

385
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,583
I said it was a waste.

386
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,750
Katara, you're not braiding.

387
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,083
You know I was never good at this.

388
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,041
Sokka used to tease me about…

389
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,916
Where's Sokka?

390
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,833
He and your father should be back
from their fishing expedition soon.

391
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Katara…

392
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,458
I can't bend.

393
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,208
You will. I know it.

394
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:09,208
Someday, you are gonna show the world
just how powerful you are.

395
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,458
You will protect all of us.

396
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,833
Fire Nation! Run!

397
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,291
Hide her.

398
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,375
- Find the Waterbender!
- Go!

399
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,291
Katara, we have to get inside now!

400
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,666
No, I'm not going in there!

401
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
Hide.

402
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,541
And whatever you do, don't come out.

403
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:35,250
Where's the Waterbender?
We know you have one in the village.

404
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,833
All the Waterbenders are gone or dead
because of you.

405
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,166
You're lying.

406
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,958
Turn the bender over.

407
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,666
Or die.

408
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,000
Wait!

409
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:33,708
It's me.

410
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,083
I'm the Waterbender.

411
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,416
So much fear.

412
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,208
So much despair.

413
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,333
Ooh.

414
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,083
Spirit World. More like mud world.

415
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,625
It smells like Appa after a rainstorm.

416
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,041
Well, that doesn't seem right.

417
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,416
Dad?

418
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,416
The spirits of water
bear witness to this mark.

419
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:11,375
For the strength and leadership
displayed during his ice-dodging trials,

420
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,041
I grant this Mark of the Wise…

421
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,708
to Sokka.

422
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,250
To my son.

423
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,291
Huh!

424
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,416
This is the day of my ice-dodging trials.

425
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,166
This is the day
you passed your ice-dodging trials.

426
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,625
Just as the warriors in our family
always have.

427
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,250
You did make it exciting though.

428
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,250
Bato!

429
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,083
You were cutting it a little close
around those icebergs, weren't ya?

430
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,583
Yeah, that's right. I lost control.

431
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,791
I…

432
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,375
I didn't know what to do.

433
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,875
If you hadn't have been on the boat
and stepped in…

434
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,333
We all came through in one piece.

435
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,375
That's all that matters. Right, Hakoda?

436
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:03,583
Yes, that's right,
and selecting the right crew

437
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,583
is part of being a wise leader.

438
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:08,208
It's why we do the trials
with help from our friends.

439
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,583
You see?

440
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,125
Why don't you go find your sister?
And we can all celebrate.

441
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,750
Hey, Sokka.

442
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,833
We just saw your ice-dodging cutter
or what remains of it.

443
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,041
If this is how you pass a test,

444
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,500
I'd hate to see
what you do to a boat when you fail.

445
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,958
What a joke.

446
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,125
I didn't think
he'd get in trouble that quickly.

447
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,083
If it weren't for you,
Sokka would have wrecked us.

448
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,208
We're lucky to be alive.

449
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:46,208
It was tricky. Even I only saw
the breakers at the last second.

450
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,750
You don't have to make excuses for him.

451
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:51,541
I'd hoped,

452
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,250
when he really had to prove himself,
that he'd do…

453
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,125
better.

454
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:07,041
The truth is, not everyone is meant
to have people's lives in their hands.

455
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,291
Give in to your despair.

456
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,291
Katara!

457
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Sokka!

458
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,291
Home.

459
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,791
It isn't real.

460
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,375
It isn't real.

461
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,875
What have we here?

462
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,125
Someone who can resist?

463
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,333
That can't be possible.

464
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:36,916
Unless…

465
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,958
Ah, of course.

466
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,083
It's my old friend, the Avatar.

467
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,500
Do I know you?

468
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,250
I should say so.

469
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:53,541
One of your previous incarnations
tried to slay me.

470
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,958
Why would I try to kill you?

471
00:36:56,041 --> 00:37:01,541
Oh, it was something about
stealing the face of someone you loved.

472
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,250
But you know all about stealing,
don't you?

473
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:09,875
Perhaps you've come
to return what you stole from me.

474
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:14,125
I don't know what you're talking about.
All I want is to find my friends.

475
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,875
Your friends?

476
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:26,375
Now, why would I let you
play with my food?

477
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,250
Hello?

478
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:09,791
Aang?

479
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,541
Gyatso?

480
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,541
Aang!

481
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,375
You finally made it!

482
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,333
This isn't… this isn't real.
It can't be. It's another trick.

483
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,041
It's another illusion.

484
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:31,000
I know it's hard to believe,
but… it's really me.

485
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:36,125
There are lots of Illusions here,
but you've emerged from the fog.

486
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,833
This is real.

487
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,166
Recognize this?

488
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,000
One of the last games we played.

489
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,250
Hey!

490
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,875
Ah.

491
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,375
Your turn.

492
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,458
Cheater.

493
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,333
I can't believe it's really you.

494
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,166
How is this possible?

495
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,000
How are you… here?

496
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,708
Ah. Well…

497
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,541
after you left the Southern Air Temple,
the Firebenders attacked.

498
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,541
It was sudden and swift.

499
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,500
Most who perished
moved on in the Great Cycle.

500
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,083
I chose a different path.

501
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,541
You chose not to move on
to the next stage of enlightenment?

502
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,833
Why?

503
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:50,958
Because

504
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,250
I knew you would need me.

505
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,708
I do need you.

506
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:59,541
I'm supposed to be the Avatar,
and everyone is counting on me,

507
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,750
except I don't know what I'm doing.

508
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,833
But now you're here.

509
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,291
Aang, I can't tell you
how to be the Avatar.

510
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,000
Of course you can.

511
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,166
Avatar Kyoshi told me
that I need to get to the North

512
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,458
to prevent a great tragedy from happening.

513
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,000
Except… I don't know how.

514
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,666
I don't know anything.

515
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,333
- You know a lot more than you think.
- I doubt that.

516
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:30,166
I mean, how am I supposed
to save the world

517
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,541
if I can't even save…

518
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,625
my friends?

519
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,083
They're somewhere in the fog.

520
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,000
Ah.

521
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,750
That is the Fog of Lost Souls.

522
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,291
A place that imprisons people
in their darkest memories,

523
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:52,500
and it is the hunting ground for Koh,
the face stealer.

524
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,416
He preys on those
paralyzed by despair and doubt.

525
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:01,041
He must have the villagers too.
The ones we came to rescue.

526
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,875
<i>Koh</i>
<i>will have taken them to his lair.</i>

527
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>Koh will hold them there</i>
<i>until he's ready to feed.</i>

528
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,250
<i>When that happens,</i>

529
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>their souls will be lost forever.</i>

530
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,750
I have to save them!

531
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,750
Koh is a primal spirit,

532
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,583
a dangerous and ruthless predator.

533
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,291
There is no way to defeat him.

534
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,541
I have to try.

535
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,708
I have to do something.

536
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,375
Koh.

537
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,500
He said that he knew me.

538
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,750
That I've taken something from him.

539
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,750
It's true. Previous Avatars
have tangled with Koh.

540
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,541
It's said Roku once
even got the best of the spirit,

541
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,916
but nobody knows exactly what happened.

542
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,958
Okay.

543
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,250
Then… I need to talk to Roku.

544
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,458
I've contacted Avatar Kyoshi
at her shrine.

545
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,875
I can do the same with Roku.

546
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,916
Except Roku's temple
is in the Fire Nation.

547
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,833
-It'll be a dangerous journey.
-I don't have a choice.

548
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,833
I'll be back.

549
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:09,875
Aang!

550
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,250
There's something I need to tell you.

551
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:21,458
You… couldn't have done anything…
if you'd stayed with us.

552
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,708
You couldn't have stopped the Fire Nation.

553
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,291
You couldn't have prevented the war.

554
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,583
You would have just died
along with everyone else.

555
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,416
It's not your fault.

556
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,291
So… let go.

557
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,541
Can we talk about it when I get back?

558
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:55,875
Of course.

559
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,333
You should hurry.
Koh will feed again before too long.

560
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:04,541
Right. Once I save my friends,
we'll have more time.

561
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:20,666
Time.

562
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,625
Time is a funny thing.

563
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,208
The past, the future,

564
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,666
it all gets mixed up.

565
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,958
<i>There's only one way to keep it straight.</i>

566
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,625
<i>It's by remembering what really matters.</i>

567
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,291
I hope
you can help me, Avatar Roku.

568
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,833
I know you're in pain. I saw your spirit.

569
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:18,750
I'm gonna make this right,
and I'm gonna save my friends.

570
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:20,333
I promise.

571
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,708
Sorry, buddy. You can't come this time.

572
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,458
You too, Momo.

573
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,250
It's too dangerous.

574
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,458
Keep them safe for me, okay?

575
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:50,541
<i>Of course, keeping sight</i>
<i>of what's important can be hard.</i>

576
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:57,000
<i>Sometimes it feels like</i>
<i>we'll always be alone.</i>

577
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,208
<i>And the only thing</i>
<i>keeping us company is our own pain.</i>

578
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,000
<i>We tell ourselves</i>
<i>we are the problem.</i>

579
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:27,458
<i>Especially when things</i>
<i>we can't control come our way.</i>

580
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,250
<i>That's why we must let go</i>
<i>of our pain and regret</i>

581
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:49,875
<i>and remember what it is</i>
<i>we're really fighting for.</i>

582
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,250
<i>The ones we love.</i>

583
00:45:56,541 --> 00:46:00,958
<i>Let that be the light that guides you</i>
<i>through the most treacherous of times…</i>

584
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,583
<i>and the darkest of nights.</i>
