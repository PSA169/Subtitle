1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,916
There he is! Cut him off!

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,125
Stop in the name of…

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,250
Right there!

4
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,166
- Go!
- Go!

5
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,291
He's over there! Get him!

6
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,583
- There he is.
- Don't let him get away!

7
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,458
After him!

8
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,750
Stop!

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,666
An Earthbender.

10
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,458
Hurry!

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,208
Come on!

12
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,583
Now! Now!

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,625
He went that way!

14
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,333
Get that to the Earth King.

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,625
They're going to start a war!

16
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,458
- There!
- Go now!

17
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,083
You're too late.

18
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,708
Your battle plans are already on their way
to the Earth Kingdom.

19
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,916
Good.

20
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,708
That means all eyes
will be on the Earth Kingdom.

21
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,958
All eyes but ours.

22
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,208
We'll be prepared for your attack.

23
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,583
When your king receives those plans,

24
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,166
he will redirect his forces
to your borders

25
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,958
and rally the support
of the other nations.

26
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,458
The Water Tribes
and the Air Nomads and the entire world

27
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,333
will turn their attention
to the Earthbenders.

28
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,166
You… you wanted us to know?

29
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,750
We aren't the real target.

30
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,625
My sights are set higher.

31
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,333
Much higher.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,833
Why?

33
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:03,958
Why are you doing this?

34
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,625
Because it is our time.

35
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,916
A masterful ruse, Your Highness.

36
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,875
But tactically,
the Airbenders are not the threat.

37
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,166
This isn't about the Airbenders.

38
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
This is about one who lives among them.

39
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,958
The only one
who could possibly stand in our way.

40
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,125
But the Avatar is yet to be revealed.

41
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,166
Which is why we have to kill them all.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,250
<i>Water.</i>

43
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,416
<i>Earth.</i>

44
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,208
<i>Fire.</i>

45
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,625
<i>Air.</i>

46
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,958
<i>For millennia,</i>
<i>the four nations have lived in harmony,</i>

47
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,791
<i>a peace made possible by the Avatar…</i>

48
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,750
<i>the one person with the ability</i>
<i>to master all four elements</i>

49
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,250
<i>and protect the delicate balance</i>
<i>between nations.</i>

50
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,875
<i>When one Avatar dies,</i>

51
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,500
<i>their spirit is reborn into a new body</i>
<i>in an eternal cycle.</i>

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,333
<i>Since the death of the last Avatar,</i>

53
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,666
<i>the new incarnation has yet to emerge.</i>

54
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,041
<i>And so Fire Lord Sozin,</i>
<i>the ruthless leader of the Fire Nation,</i>

55
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:57,083
<i>believes this is his moment</i>
<i>to launch a merciless campaign</i>

56
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,625
<i>to conquer the world.</i>

57
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,083
<i>His first step is</i>
<i>to eliminate the one person</i>

58
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,375
<i>who could stand in his way.</i>

59
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,958
<i>The next master of all four elements,</i>

60
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,791
<i>an Airbender who may not be ready</i>
<i>for the responsibility of becoming</i>

61
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,541
<i>the Avatar.</i>

62
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,208
Aang!

63
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,166
Aang!

64
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,666
- Hey, look!
- Yeah!

65
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,166
Wow!

66
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,666
Who else?

67
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,791
Whoa!

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,083
Show-off.

69
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,000
- What? I was just enjoying the view.
- Ha.

70
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,416
Monk Tsutop was looking for you.

71
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You skipped training again!

72
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,375
It's all the same drills.
You know I already know all this stuff.

73
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,375
Aang.

74
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:58,416
You may be more advanced than the others,
but there's much you have to learn.

75
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,166
And believe it or not,

76
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,250
there may come a day when you wish
you'd spent more time with your teachers.

77
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, you and the other students
better go help set up

78
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,750
for the Great Comet Festival.

79
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,000
Still a lot of work to be done

80
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,250
before the Air Nomads
from the other temples arrive.

81
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,583
How many are coming?

82
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,458
Wait. What's that sound?

83
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,166
Look! Up there!

84
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,708
Look at all of them.

85
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,625
Wow! There's so many!

86
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,875
Look at all of them!

87
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,000
All of them.

88
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,750
Come on, Aang! They're right up there!

89
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,208
Wait up!

90
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,083
Did you tell him?

91
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,166
- It wasn't the right time.
- The right time?

92
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,916
We don't have the luxury
of waiting for the right time.

93
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,083
We need to go talk to the council now.

94
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,541
<i>Aang has always been a prodigy.</i>

95
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,125
The youngest Airbender in history

96
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,583
to receive the markings of a master.

97
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,875
But he is only 12.

98
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,041
We can't ask this of him.

99
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,541
Fire Lord Sozin
is planning to attack the Earth Kingdom.

100
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,666
The Water Tribes are already sending
the warriors to aid the Earthbenders,

101
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,500
and we need to help them as well.

102
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,125
And we need the Avatar.

103
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:35,208
Yes, Aang is powerful,
but there's much he still needs to learn

104
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,500
about responsibility,

105
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,958
expectations,

106
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,791
sacrifice.

107
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Most of all, he needs to know who he is.

108
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,541
If we send him away
before he learns these things,

109
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,416
he could fail to be
everything we need him to be.

110
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,416
And he and the world

111
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,958
might never recover from that.

112
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,208
The role of the Avatar
is a heavy responsibility,

113
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,458
not meant for a child.

114
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,000
But it is not our place
to choose who bears that burden,

115
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,166
and I fear you've grown too close to Aang
to see that, Brother Gyatso.

116
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,916
Aang must leave immediately

117
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,333
to begin training
in the other bending disciplines,

118
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,791
and we can only hope

119
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,500
that it is not too late for him
to make a difference.

120
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,250
Are comet festivals always this much work?

121
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,958
Well, the last one was
a hundred years ago,

122
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,041
and believe it or not,

123
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,791
I'm actually not old enough
to have seen that.

124
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,458
Could have fooled me.

125
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,125
Remember the last time I brought you here?

126
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,416
Sure. When I got my tattoos.

127
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,541
Most receive their markings
in the main hall,

128
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,958
but I wanted you to receive yours
in the presence of Yangchen,

129
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,791
the last Air Nomad to be the Avatar.

130
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,500
When she died, the next Avatar was born

131
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,083
into the following nation
in the eternal cycle,

132
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,750
so after Yangchen's death

133
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:13,125
came Kuruk of the Water Tribes,
then Kyoshi of the Earth Kingdom…

134
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,833
And then Roku in the Fire Nation.

135
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,833
Which means the next Avatar

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,250
will once again be an Airbender.

137
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,708
Her spirit echoes in one of us.

138
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,250
Aang, you have always been special.

139
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,583
The most talented Airbender
I have ever known.

140
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,958
I never asked to be special.

141
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,041
But you are.

142
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,416
Aang,

143
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,458
you are the Avatar.

144
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,166
The Fire Nation
has embarked on a dark path.

145
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,208
Their actions threaten
to throw the world out of balance.

146
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,333
Only the Avatar, the one person
who can master all four elements,

147
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,708
can save the world.

148
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,333
The world needs the Avatar.

149
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,708
The world needs you, Aang.

150
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,875
You're to leave right away so you can
begin training in the other disciplines.

151
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,166
Right away?

152
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,416
Leave my friends? Leave home? Leave you?

153
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,541
Now, this

154
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,416
would be a huge burden for anyone,

155
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,125
but you're not just anyone, Aang.

156
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,041
You're strong

157
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,083
and kind

158
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,083
and generous.

159
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,541
Remember that.

160
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,000
Always remember who you are

161
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,041
because I can't imagine a better person
to have been given this power.

162
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,541
I don't want… the power.

163
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,875
Which is why you will make a great Avatar.

164
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,750
Why do I have to be different?

165
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,250
Can't I just

166
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,291
keep pretending that I'm your friend?

167
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,625
You are my friend.

168
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,958
You… will always be my friend.

169
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,166
Hey, Appa.

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,125
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

171
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,500
Gyatso says I'm supposed to be the Avatar.

172
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,875
Me.

173
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,041
Monks don't even trust me
to feed the baby bison,

174
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,250
and I'm supposed to save the world?

175
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,041
He said I need to remember who I am.

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,875
But I know who I am.

177
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,791
I like to play airball
and eat banana cakes

178
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,958
and goof off with my friends.

179
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,250
That's who I am,

180
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,708
not someone who can stop the Fire Nation.

181
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,625
Not someone who can stop a war.

182
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,166
The other kids always say I'm lucky
because of the things I could do,

183
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,500
but I'd trade places with any of them.

184
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,708
I don't wanna leave.

185
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,916
I don't want the responsibility.

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,958
I'm scared of my power.
I'm scared of being alone!

187
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm scared.

188
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,041
You're right.

189
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,458
I just need to go up
where things always make more sense.

190
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,250
At least for now.

191
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,666
Yip, yip!

192
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,708
Remember,

193
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,041
no survivors.

194
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,166
Brothers and sisters, we're under attack!

195
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,125
Yah!

196
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,041
- What's going on?
- Come with me, quickly!

197
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,541
Where's Aang?

198
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,000
Aang!

199
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,000
Quickly, move along.

200
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,041
It's getting kind of rough, Appa.
Maybe we should head back home?

201
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,125
That's it.
Stay quiet. You'll be safe in there.

202
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,208
Right into the corner.

203
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,041
Stay down.

204
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,750
It's okay, Appa!

205
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,458
Steady!

206
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
Oh!

207
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,333
You may have prevailed on another night.

208
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,125
But not when we have
the power of the comet!

209
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,541
Ah!

210
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,750
Come on!

211
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,083
All right, listen up.

212
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,916
We've been manning the wall
in three-hour shifts,

213
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,083
but it seems some of you can't be trusted
to stay at your posts.

214
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,791
So from now on,

215
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,916
two people at all times,
meaning twice as many shifts.

216
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,791
Is there a problem?

217
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,083
Didn't think so.
Okay, back to your duties.

218
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,625
Come on, let's go.

219
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,291
Where are we going?

220
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,125
The fishing boats came back empty.

221
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,750
Just proves if you want something
done right, gotta do it yourself.

222
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,500
They don't appreciate
your incredible leadership skills.

223
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,250
That's right. They don't realize it.

224
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,500
Very funny.

225
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,791
Katara!

226
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,375
So where were you before?

227
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,000
You were waterbending again, weren't you?

228
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,291
Don't worry. No one could see me.

229
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,333
Not that it matters.

230
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,208
Of course it matters. If the Fire Nation
finds out you're a Waterbender--

231
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,416
No one from the Fire Nation
has approached the village in years.

232
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,541
Besides, there's nothing to see.

233
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,541
An otter penguin
could bend more water than I could.

234
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,666
It's probably for the best.

235
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,000
You should be helping out more
around the village anyway.

236
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,458
Not everything
is about preparing to fight.

237
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,000
-We're at war.
-Waterbending is what built our culture.

238
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,666
Our way of life.
Keeping it alive is our duty.

239
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,208
-Keeping ourselves alive is our duty.
-I know that.

240
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,166
-And if Dad were here--
-But he's not here! I am!

241
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,750
Katara.

242
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,291
Katara. Sulk later, paddle now.

243
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,625
Good job.

244
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,166
I'm not doing this.

245
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,125
Sokka!

246
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:52,958
You okay?

247
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,833
Oh no. No, no, that's not good.

248
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,291
What is that?

249
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,416
Huh, weird.

250
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,125
We need to get that canoe,
or we're gonna end up as fish food,

251
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,541
which would be ironic.

252
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,666
Maybe I could float over on some ice?

253
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,000
Uh, Katara?

254
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:51,958
Finally.

255
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,708
Where did he come from?

256
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,458
I don't know.

257
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,916
Oh! Nice. Nice. We're not gonna die.

258
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,875
Come on. Let's go home.

259
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,750
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?

260
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,000
You're not thinking of leaving him?

261
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:44,791
Katara, a strange, glowy iceberg
just exploded and left behind

262
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,541
a mysterious little bald person.

263
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,083
What part of that makes you think,
"Great, let's bring him home"?

264
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,541
Sokka, he's just a kid.

265
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,250
We can't just leave him out here.

266
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,875
I don't like this, but why listen to me?

267
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,916
I'm just responsible
for the safety of the village.

268
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,791
-He looks dead.
-What's that mark on his head?

269
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,333
Let me take a look.

270
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
It can't be.

271
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,291
What is it, Gran Gran?

272
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,500
This is an Airbender.

273
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,583
It's impossible.
Airbenders don't exist anymore.

274
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:43,166
Well, we won't get any answers
until he wakes up.

275
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,833
We need to let him rest.

276
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,375
Come on.

277
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,666
The only settlement in that area
is Water Tribe Village

278
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,958
in the South Pole territory.
That's where we have to go.

279
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,583
-Where you think we'll find the Avatar?
-Yes.

280
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,791
Because of the light?

281
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,125
You think I'm imagining things?

282
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,583
Sometimes, light beams are nothing more
than celestial glimmers in the winter sky.

283
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:19,583
For three years,
I've chased down every hint, every rumor,

284
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,000
every whisper of the Avatar,

285
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,125
and I'll keep doing it
for another three years if I have to.

286
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:29,000
Prince Zuko,
I don't think your father would want you--

287
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,958
My father has banished me
until I find the Avatar,

288
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,125
and that's exactly what I'll do.

289
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,666
All I'm saying is,
it's hard to see you get your hopes up

290
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,208
every time you see a…

291
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,125
a sign.

292
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,666
It'll all be worth it
once I return home in glory

293
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,541
to take my place
as the rightful heir to the Fire Lord.

294
00:29:56,708 --> 00:30:00,375
Perhaps it's time to consider
that the throne isn't everything.

295
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,500
It may not have been for you.

296
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,166
But for me…

297
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,791
it's my destiny.

298
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,125
Come on. Come on.

299
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,541
Come on. Come on!

300
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,958
Got you!

301
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,500
Gotcha!

302
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,958
Hey, get away from him!

303
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,750
What are you thinking?
Have you forgotten your training?

304
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,291
What'd I say about keeping your guard up?
He could be the enemy.

305
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:26,250
The enemy?

306
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,291
I'm not the enemy.

307
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:29,958
Then who are you?

308
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:31,916
I'm Aang.

309
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,333
Where am I?

310
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,791
-How'd I get here?
-You tell me.

311
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,750
Wait.

312
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,458
Appa?

313
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Appa!

314
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,041
Where's Appa?

315
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,791
Sokka!

316
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,666
Have you seen him?

317
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,125
Yeah.

318
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,750
That's not strange at all.

319
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,000
- This is unbelievable.
- Appa!

320
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,875
He is an Airbender.

321
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,958
Have you seen Appa?

322
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,000
My sky bison.

323
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:16,875
Six legs, horns, brown arrows?

324
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,666
Sky bison.

325
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,041
-Sky bison!
-Repeating it doesn't help.

326
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,958
- Whoa!
- What is that thing?

327
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,333
Appa!

328
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,583
Sky bison.

329
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,916
You say you went down in the storm?

330
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,166
It came upon us suddenly.

331
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,541
The weather went crazy
just after I left home.

332
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,041
The Southern Air Temple.

333
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,333
Where the Air Nomads live.

334
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,083
Well, not all the Air Nomads,

335
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,041
but most of them had just arrived
for the Great Comet Festival.

336
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,750
The Great Comet Festival.

337
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,875
Gran Gran?

338
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:15,291
Water, earth, fire, air.

339
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:19,333
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

340
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:23,500
Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.

341
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,916
Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,

342
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,208
could stop them.

343
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,958
But when the world needed him most,

344
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,666
he vanished.

345
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,000
And so the Fire Nation
marched and laid waste,

346
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,125
plunging us into a time of darkness.

347
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,875
Everyone in the village knows this story,

348
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,583
but you don't, do you, young man?

349
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:56,125
Just as you don't know that Airbenders
haven't been seen in generations

350
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,708
and that the Southern Air Temple
was the first to fall,

351
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,875
because you've been trapped
in that ice this whole time.

352
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,708
The last time that the Great Comet
was seen in the sky

353
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,000
was 100 years ago.

354
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,708
He may seem like just a boy,

355
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,458
but he's much more.

356
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,083
He is the last Airbender.

357
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,250
Of all the places to drag our asses to,
he picks the coldest spot in the world.

358
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,458
How come his omens never take us
somewhere with hot springs, huh?

359
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,916
-Something you wanna say, Lieutenant Jee?
-No, sir.

360
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,791
Let me make something clear.

361
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,750
Our mission is vital
to the future of the Fire Nation,

362
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,041
and so we will find the Avatar.

363
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,000
We will prove ourselves worthy,

364
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,708
and we will see
our homes and families again…

365
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:09,500
or we will die trying.

366
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,500
Are you okay?

367
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,583
A hundred years.

368
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,375
All my friends,

369
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,208
everyone I know…

370
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,083
they're all gone.

371
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,625
Um, I'm sorry.

372
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,458
Believe me, I know how hard it is
to lose the people you love.

373
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,833
When I was little,
I didn't really understand the war

374
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,750
until the night the Firebenders came.

375
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,500
They destroyed everything in their path.

376
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,750
Everything.

377
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,083
Everyone.

378
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,500
Afterwards, our father set out
with the other warriors

379
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,916
to hunt down the Firebenders.

380
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,000
That was three years ago,
and we haven't seen him since.

381
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,750
He had left Sokka in charge
when he just turned 13.

382
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,000
I guess he had to grow up fast.

383
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:27,791
We all did.

384
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,000
We're never really ready

385
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,541
until we have to be.

386
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:48,541
They were part of the Fire Nation's
first attacks on the Water Tribe.

387
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,791
The Firebenders were ruthless.

388
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,166
Since then, the Fire Nation
has conquered most of the world.

389
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,583
But the Waterbenders
are still fighting back,

390
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,416
especially in the North.

391
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,416
And the Earth Kingdom
is still holding strong.

392
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,208
We hope.

393
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,458
I had friends in the Fire Nation.

394
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:12,875
I used to visit them.

395
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,125
No one visits other nations now.

396
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,833
We're only friends with our own kind.

397
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,291
Good. Your skills have never been sharper.

398
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:37,291
I need to be at my best
when I face the world's ultimate warrior.

399
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,041
They say Avatar Kyoshi took down
an entire squadron

400
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,875
of Earth Kingdom soldiers single-handedly.

401
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,125
Well, you've certainly prepared enough.

402
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:47,333
Now, how about a nice cup of jasmine tea?

403
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:54,666
Say we find the Avatar,
and you're able to defeat him,

404
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,416
a mission
your father believed to be impossible.

405
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,125
And so your return home may be…

406
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:03,875
unexpected.

407
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:07,750
You're wrong.

408
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,791
No one comes here.

409
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,916
It's quiet and hidden.

410
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,291
You're a Waterbender!

411
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,958
Barely. I'm trying to get better,

412
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,708
but I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Tribe.

413
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,791
Sokka doesn't like it when I practice

414
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:46,000
because he's worried
that the Fire Nation will find out and…

415
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,166
And what?

416
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,333
There's a reason I'm the only Waterbender
left in the village.

417
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,041
They've killed all the others.

418
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,083
Sokka just doesn't understand.

419
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,291
I'm a warrior. I should be able
to do more for our people.

420
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:08,291
The monks told me
bending is about energy and balance.

421
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:13,250
By feeling the energy around you,
you can find balance.

422
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,500
By finding balance,
you can feel the energy.

423
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,125
Nice!

424
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,500
I wasn't even really trying.

425
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,666
That's good. You just have to let go.

426
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,416
Katara?

427
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,375
Sokka! Sokka, the Fire Nation. They're--

428
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,791
I know. We spotted them.
Get to your posts now!

429
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,208
-Sokka, the racks--
-Get them loaded.

430
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,166
I don't understand. Why are they here?

431
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:29,250
After all this time,
what could they possibly want?

432
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,041
Him.

433
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,416
He's more than the last Airbender.
Aren't you?

434
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,083
You are the Avatar.

435
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,375
Aang?

436
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,500
I knew he was hiding something.

437
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:54,041
When the world needed the Avatar the most,
he vanished because he's a coward.

438
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,166
He ran, and people died.

439
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,250
Sokka, they've landed.

440
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,083
You need to go hide.

441
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,750
-Sokka, I wanna--
-Katara, now.

442
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,916
Come on. We need to get somewhere safe.

443
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,791
I am Prince Zuko.

444
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Firstborn son of Fire Lord Ozai.

445
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,833
We have no desire to take your homes.

446
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,666
We merely seek someone
who does not belong here.

447
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,041
Someone who is not one of you.

448
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,666
Turn him over now,

449
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:46,666
or I'll burn this place to the ground.

450
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,041
-Where is he?
-Sokka, you can't give him to them--

451
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,291
-He doesn't belong here.
-It's wrong. You know that!

452
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,291
What I know
is Dad told me to protect the village.

453
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,416
Yes, but remember what Mom told us too.

454
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,041
She said that we have to protect those
who can't protect themselves.

455
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,083
He's lost everything he knows.

456
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,625
-Sokka, don't you see? He's the Avatar!
-And he lied to us about it!

457
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:12,041
I know how hard
this responsibility has been for you,

458
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,750
but there's more to being a leader
than just catching fish.

459
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,000
You have to give people
something to live for.

460
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,833
That's what the Avatar is. He's hope.

461
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,875
And we need that
just as much as we need food and shelter.

462
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:26,708
I know I do.

463
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,916
I am Sokka.

464
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:00,916
Son of Hakoda.

465
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,916
Lord of, uh,

466
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,333
Snow and Ice.

467
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,208
On behalf
of the Water Tribe Village of Wolf Cove,

468
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,125
I demand that you leave immediately!

469
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,791
If this is the path you've chosen,

470
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,583
then so be it.

471
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,333
Let's settle this between us!
Leader to leader. You really need an army?

472
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,333
I thought you Firebenders had some guts.

473
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:25,708
Don't fall for it.
We overpower them. It's no contest.

474
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,041
Well, where's the glory in that?

475
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,416
I accept.

476
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,583
Who needs an army now?

477
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,041
Leave him alone!

478
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:23,708
Can't be.

479
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,583
Ah!

480
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,541
Enough games.
Burn the whole place to the ground.

481
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,083
No!

482
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,958
I'll go with you. Just leave them alone.

483
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm the one you're looking for.

484
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,458
-Get him.
-Wait!

485
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,208
It's okay, Katara.

486
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,625
No one has ever fought for me before.

487
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,958
I think you're the bravest person
I've ever met.

488
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,416
We have to do something.
Sokka, we have to help him. Sokka!

489
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,666
Okay, listen up.

490
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,625
Reinforce the braces on the gate,
and don't fall behind on drills.

491
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,250
-I saw real sloppiness out there today.
-Drills?

492
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,375
And don't let the younger ones
push you around.

493
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,375
You gotta let 'em know who's in charge.
That's right.

494
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:10,833
You're in charge.

495
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,916
Now, let's go save that weird kid.

496
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:31,958
There are many who never imagined
this day would ever come, myself included.

497
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,125
Can I ask you something?

498
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,375
-Uh…
-Forgive me.

499
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,958
I'm Iroh, son of Fire Lord Azulon.

500
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,125
And of course.

501
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:47,166
Why did the Fire Nation start this war?

502
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,083
Ah.

503
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:51,750
Some people say it is within our nature

504
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,166
to expand and consume like fire itself.

505
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:59,208
Others believe
that true stability in this world

506
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,250
can only happen under our rule,

507
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:05,875
so the drive to conquer
is a drive for peace and unity.

508
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:10,208
But peace comes from respecting life,
not killing and destroying.

509
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,083
A noble sentiment, Avatar,

510
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,833
but in the end, for most of us,

511
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,500
it doesn't matter how this war started.

512
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,583
It only matters how it can end.

513
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,791
And the belief is that by capturing you,

514
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,375
the Fire Nation
can finally bring that about.

515
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,041
Is that what you believe?

516
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:37,291
I must leave, but I look forward to
many more conversations with you, Avatar.

517
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:41,958
In the meantime,
I'll have some jasmine tea sent to you.

518
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,958
It's quite soothing.

519
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,875
-It won't be easy to catch them.
-I know.

520
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,166
Hopefully, we can find a swift current.
Maybe draft off their wake.

521
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:21,958
Or

522
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,666
we could go another way.

523
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,291
You're not serious.

524
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,083
Katara, no!
There's no way you're getting me on that…

525
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,666
The Avatars.

526
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,916
Yes, sir, right away.

527
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,458
Stop!

528
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:48,625
Stop him!

529
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,541
Get him!

530
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,958
Open fire, now!

531
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:11,708
Ah!

532
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,041
Hey, kid!

533
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,000
Sokka!

534
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,250
Ah!

535
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:39,666
I can't believe
you guys came for me. Thank you.

536
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,083
It's time we showed those flameheads
they can't step on us.

537
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:48,333
The Firebenders aren't gonna give up.
They're gonna keep coming after you.

538
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,000
Which means we can't go home.

539
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,708
It would put everyone in danger.

540
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,000
So where do we go?

541
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,416
Gyatso.

542
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,958
Now, this would be
a huge burden for anyone,

543
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,625
<i>but you're not just anyone, Aang.</i>

544
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,083
You're strong

545
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:46,083
and kind and generous.

546
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,208
<i>Remember that.</i>

547
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,833
<i>Always remember who you are.</i>

548
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:06,125
Aang?

549
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,625
What's happening?
What is he doing?

550
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,208
Aang!

551
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,333
Come on!

552
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,291
Aang!

553
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,208
Aang!

554
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,500
Stop this!

555
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,291
Please!

556
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:51,916
Aang!

557
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,750
<i>Aang,</i>

558
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,958
I can't imagine a better person

559
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:03,083
to have been given this power.

560
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,125
<i>You are my friend.</i>

561
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,625
You will always be my friend.

562
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,375
So not to be rude,
but what was that?

563
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,250
I don't know.

564
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,291
There's so much I don't know.

565
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:27,958
The monks are gone, and I'm all alone.

566
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:30,208
You know,

567
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,041
the thing about losing everything

568
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,833
is that that's when you learn
how strong you really are.

569
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,041
It's when you learn to fight.

570
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:44,000
They made
the ultimate sacrifice for me.

571
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,208
I need to make sure
their deaths weren't in vain.

572
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,416
I need to follow through
on what they wanted me to do.

573
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,416
Complete my training
and master all the other bending skills

574
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,541
so I can bring balance back to the world.

575
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:55,708
Oh, is that all?

576
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,041
This was my home, and now it's gone.

577
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,875
<i>It's only after</i>
<i>we've lost something</i>

578
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,333
<i>that we realize how much it means to us…</i>

579
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,833
<i>and how we'd do anything to get it back.</i>

580
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,333
<i>Anything.</i>

581
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:25,708
I don't know where this will all lead,
and I don't know if I have what it takes,

582
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,458
but the one thing I do know is

583
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,416
I'm the Avatar,

584
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,250
<i>and this is just the beginning.</i>
