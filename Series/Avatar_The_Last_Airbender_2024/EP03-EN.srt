1
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,416
Everything is set.

2
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,541
We strike tonight.

3
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,291
Shouldn't we wait?
We don't have the numbers.

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,166
We don't need numbers.

5
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,875
We have our anger.

6
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,375
We have our grief.

7
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,000
And for the first time in a century,

8
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,791
we have hope.

9
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,500
I want you to meet someone
willing to risk everything for our cause.

10
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,458
Like all of us,

11
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,625
she has lost too much.

12
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,125
My mother and my brother.

13
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,416
In the Siege of Ba Sing Se.

14
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,750
She works at the palace.

15
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,833
She's willing to help us
at great personal risk.

16
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,875
If she can summon the courage,

17
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,208
so must we all.

18
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,833
Fire Lord Ozai must die tonight!

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
There is no way out.

20
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,041
But you must have known
this was a one-way journey.

21
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,000
Or did you expect my men
to just lay down their arms

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,541
after you slaughtered their Fire Lord?

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,625
We expected
that all decent Fire Nation citizens

24
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,875
would've welcomed
being freed from your tyranny.

25
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:53,916
Tyranny?

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,916
Don't you mean… unity?

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,166
Prosperity?

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,291
Are we not
the greatest nation in the world?

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,375
Have I not led us to the brink
of bringing the entire world

30
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,708
under one rule,

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,666
our rule,

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,083
to ensure an era of peace?

33
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,541
At what cost?

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,000
How many more lives?

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,583
Will it take another century
of loss and suffering?

36
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,083
Do not speak to me of loss.

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,416
My compliments on making it this far.

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,958
Then again, we in the Fire Nation

39
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,333
have always prided ourselves
on our resourcefulness.

40
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,708
Isn't that right,

41
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,125
Azula?

42
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,416
Yes, Father.

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,458
You may have stopped us tonight, Ozai,

44
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,000
but there is one out there
who cannot be stopped.

45
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,750
The one who will restore balance
to the world.

46
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,416
The one who has returned to us.

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,291
The one who will restore balance
to the world?

48
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,916
Can you believe
they think the Avatar has returned?

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Leave us.

50
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,541
What's this?

51
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,708
A message from one of my commanders
in the Southern Seas.

52
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,416
No one of any importance.

53
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,208
What he had to report, however…

54
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,875
Zuko has found the Avatar?

55
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,750
Your brother has done the impossible.

56
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,583
Just as I had asked.

57
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,666
The Avatar.

58
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,750
Really?

59
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,791
The water whip.

60
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,375
Arms.

61
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,375
Weight shift. Wrist snap.

62
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,166
Okay.

63
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't get it.

64
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,708
Basic bending forms
are mostly just physical movement,

65
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,708
but when you get into the harder moves,
like the water whip,

66
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,541
you really need to reach inside
and feel the energy flow.

67
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,000
The monks always told us

68
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,291
to find a place
where emotion meets spirit.

69
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,125
A place deeper than thought.

70
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,916
Tap into your feelings
and gather energy from them.

71
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,000
Tap into your feelings.

72
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,625
Wow. Uh…

73
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,708
That's okay. I bet it was my fault.

74
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,541
I should never be a teacher.

75
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,791
The monks always said I never listened.

76
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,625
Hmm.

77
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,500
I think that's what they said.
I never listened.

78
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,083
All the more reason for us
to get to the Northern Water Tribe, right?

79
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,083
That's right. They've got the best
waterbending masters in the world.

80
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,791
I might even listen to them.

81
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,833
Okay, it's time to go. We shouldn't
stay in the same place for too long.

82
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,625
I liked her too.

83
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,666
Yeah, she was cool.

84
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course, I have no idea
what she saw in you.

85
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey, what's not to like?

86
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,750
Look!

87
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,375
- What is it? Fire Nation?
- No!

88
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,125
I think…

89
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,625
I think it's another Airbender!

90
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,666
He's headed for that mountain.

91
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,833
That's no mountain!

92
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,250
That's Omashu!

93
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
Appa! Yip yip!

94
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,041
He could be anywhere.

95
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,916
He was headed north
when he left Kyoshi Island.

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,250
He'll need to stop for food and water.

97
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,958
He may be the Avatar,
but he still needs to eat and drink.

98
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,916
The population center, then.

99
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
- I can alert my contacts.
- No!

100
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,666
I told you,
no one else can know of his existence.

101
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,791
Understood.

102
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,416
But if I may,
we have a window of opportunity

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,916
as long as the Avatar remains
in this area.

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,250
If he gets too far north…

105
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,750
There are Fire Nation forces everywhere.
They're sure to find out.

106
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Which is why I suggest you allow me
to contact a few trusted sources.

107
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,875
They don't need to be told
any more than necessary.

108
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,166
Very good.

109
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,208
Commander Zhao's ship has arrived.

110
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,791
Perfect timing. To the Fire Nation.

111
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,125
I don't like him.

112
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,291
He does have a disagreeable quality.

113
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,041
I spoke to some of his crew.

114
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,541
Word is Zhao failed
his officer training program three times.

115
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,250
Did I ask for your opinion?

116
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,750
My apologies.

117
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,125
He was only trying to help.

118
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,708
He was gossiping about a superior officer.

119
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,791
-An officer you don't like.
-That's beside the point.

120
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,416
There is an order
to the way we do things here. Rules.

121
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,791
We are Fire Nation, even out here.

122
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
Especially out here.

123
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Omashu was carved out
of a living mountain.

124
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,916
It's one of the wonders
of the Earth Kingdom.

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Of the world, actually.

126
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,125
And they have
an incredible delivery system

127
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,333
that winds through the whole city.

128
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:37,416
And the people there,
they're artists, scientists, builders.

129
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,791
Plus, the food there is amazing.

130
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,958
You again?
What did I tell you before?

131
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,333
You! Step forward!

132
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,125
They don't take kindly
to outsiders in Omashu.

133
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,666
What makes you think we're outsiders?

134
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,833
No reason.

135
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,500
Wait.

136
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,541
We're new here,
but we have a friend we need to see.

137
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,583
We just could use
a little help getting inside.

138
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,500
Sorry.

139
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,958
It's either that or the turnip sack.

140
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,833
I'm sure you can make that look good too.

141
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,583
You and you! Step back!

142
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,083
Omashu's one
of the last Earth Kingdom strongholds.

143
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,333
Try as they might,

144
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,583
Firebenders haven't been able
to take it yet.

145
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,083
That's why they're so careful here.

146
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
So how do you know we're not a threat?

147
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,916
Just a feeling.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,541
Oh wow.

149
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,583
Hold there.

150
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,291
State your business.

151
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,083
Headed to market, as usual.

152
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,291
Oh, wasn't a great crop this month.

153
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,250
She told me
I wasn't watering the turnips enough.

154
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,375
Knew there was a reason I married her.

155
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,291
Irrigation, am I right?

156
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,541
Uh, my… my brother-in-law
would agree if he could speak.

157
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,666
Struck mute at birth.

158
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,458
You'd be amazed
at how much he can say without words.

159
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,583
Just the other day,
he made us laugh so hard--

160
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,583
All right, that's enough. Move along.

161
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,875
Thank you. Bye.

162
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,958
Good luck finding your friend.

163
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,250
And be careful.

164
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,666
Omashu can be a dangerous place.

165
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,833
There he is. Look.

166
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,125
Aang, wait up!

167
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,916
Look out!

168
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,833
Hey, watch out for my--

169
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,375
Oh!

170
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,666
You're not an Airbender.

171
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,166
An Airbender? Of course I'm not.

172
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,041
Help!

173
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,333
Aang, we can't see!

174
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,958
He's an Airbender.

175
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,458
And you're a Waterbender.

176
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,583
Teo! Teo!

177
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,458
-Are you all right? Are you hurt?
-Dad, I'm…

178
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm fine.

179
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,083
-We should get him out of the smoke.
-Here. Our house is right here.

180
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,500
Thank you.

181
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,208
-Thank you…
-Katara.

182
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,375
My name is Sai.

183
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,333
What were you doing out there?

184
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,041
I just landed. How was I to know
there'd be another bombing?

185
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,333
Bombing? You mean that wasn't an accident?

186
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,833
Nothing the Fire Nation does
is an accident.

187
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,166
The Fire Nation?

188
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,041
Yeah. Their spies
are everywhere in the city.

189
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,041
It's not safe anywhere these days.

190
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,500
Omashu can be a dangerous place.

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,416
More water. More water.

192
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,875
You're an Airbender.
Do you realize what this means?

193
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,083
We finally have a way
to take the fight to the enemy.

194
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,166
You could drop bombs on them.
Rain down destruction.

195
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,791
Air power is their weakness,
and you… you are air power.

196
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,333
Whoa.

197
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,916
Pretty great, huh?
Dad's the mechanist to the King of Omashu.

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,833
"Mechanist"?

199
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,666
Ah, just a fancy word for someone
who wastes a lot of time tinkering.

200
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,875
Don't listen to him.

201
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
He's responsible for maintaining
the best parts of the city.

202
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,291
Like our delivery system.
You've seen it, right?

203
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,875
It's amazing.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,125
I play but a small role.

205
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,916
Hey, if everyone in Omashu
were as dedicated as you,

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,375
this war would be over.

207
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,000
The Fire Nation would be
on their knees by now.

208
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,125
Yes.

209
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,291
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

210
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,958
Well, we have our own part
to play in the war. Right, Aang?

211
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,458
Yes.

212
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,041
Yes, uh, which is why we have to go.

213
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, right. Of course.

214
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,583
Just promise me
you'll really stick it to the Firebenders.

215
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,500
Make 'em pay.

216
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,708
-Sokka.
-This stuff is incredible.

217
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,083
I mean, look at this.

218
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,000
Those are for cleaning
under your toenails.

219
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,333
It can get bloody.

220
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,333
Did you see the mechanism
on that sorting machine?

221
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,708
It's spring-powered. Ingenious.
Should've done that with our kayak racks.

222
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,250
- It stopped the bleeding, I think.
- Ah! No!

223
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,375
You're all right.

224
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,333
Aang?

225
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,125
This place used to be incredible.
A place I couldn't wait to see.

226
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,791
A place where amazing things were created,
not destroyed.

227
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,916
It's my responsibility
to help these people.

228
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,125
How are you gonna do that?

229
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,291
Being the Avatar
isn't just about fighting.

230
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,625
It's about helping people,
like Teo and his father

231
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,000
and everyone in this city.

232
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,916
What about getting to the North?

233
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,166
Didn't Kyoshi tell you
you had to get there to prevent a tragedy?

234
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,833
Yes, and I'm gonna do that,
but I have to do this too.

235
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,166
If I'm gonna save the world,
I have to do it one person at a time.

236
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,791
That's why I'm staying in Omashu

237
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,291
because I wanna help, and I think I can.

238
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
Because I'm the Avatar.

239
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,333
Now tell me about these bombings.

240
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,791
"He's done the impossible."

241
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,166
He's done nothing.
He spent three years on an ocean cruise

242
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,250
while I've been here
doing everything Father has asked.

243
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,166
Who's the one risking her life
to root out traitors?

244
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,041
Oh, that's right!

245
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,416
Tell us about your mission.
Were you nervous?

246
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,916
Was your life really in danger?

247
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,375
Not really. People in the resistance
aren't the brightest of flames.

248
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,500
Then again,
what can you expect from peasants?

249
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,875
At least you got out into the city.

250
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,500
Zuko may be banished,

251
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,333
but he's out there exploring the world.

252
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,875
If I were him, I wouldn't wanna come back.

253
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,541
Yeah, well, all dear old Zuzu wants is

254
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,416
to make it back here
and take away everything I've worked for.

255
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,375
Technically, he is first in line
to be Fire Lord.

256
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,666
Not that he deserves to be.

257
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,125
He doesn't, but now he has hope.

258
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,375
- And that's dangerous.
- Retreat!

259
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,791
So what can you do about it?

260
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,041
You're here.

261
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,291
He's out there.

262
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
There are always ways to get in the game

263
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,750
if you know which pieces to play.

264
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,916
<i>The Avatar has returned.</i>

265
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,375
My mother told me stories of the Avatar
and how he'd return one day.

266
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,958
Dad, do you remember her stories?

267
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,250
What I remember is

268
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,125
that your mother was taken from us
by this cursed war

269
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,500
and everything we've had to do
to stay alive since then.

270
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,583
We worked hard,
and we kept our heads down.

271
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,583
-That's not how we'll change the world.
-But it is how we'll survive.

272
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,166
You pretend like you don't care,

273
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,708
but I know you hate the Fire Nation
as much as I do.

274
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,333
Why else would you build all this
if not to help our army?

275
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,250
Like this.

276
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,875
That's just an experiment.
I can't even get the damn thing to work.

277
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,166
Look, I'm not here to cause any trouble.

278
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,875
All I want is to help.

279
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,458
I know how. I have a hunch about
where the bombers might be gathering.

280
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
It's high up on the mountain.

281
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,125
Can't really reach there by myself,
but with your airbending…

282
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,625
Just there. The strongest updrafts
are in the morning, so we should fly then.

283
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,708
What, tomorrow?

284
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,791
No, Teo, you're supposed to
help me with the airship.

285
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,916
I still need to fix the attitude control
before I show it to the generals.

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,250
I can help with that.

287
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,125
My sources say
an Airbender was spotted there.

288
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,166
Omashu.

289
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,458
Enemy territory.

290
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,583
Indeed, but not to worry.

291
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,041
There are ways to gain entry
if you know the right people,

292
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,833
which I do.

293
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,875
I'll send two of my best men
to confirm the report.

294
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,041
-They can be in and out before--
-No.

295
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,916
Uncle Iroh and I will go. No one else.

296
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,041
As you wish.

297
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,666
I trust you understand the danger.

298
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,416
If anything happens in Omashu,
we won't be able to help you.

299
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,958
The prince and I will be fine.

300
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,708
We know what it means to be on our own.

301
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,000
-What are you do…
-Sh.

302
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,125
Fire Nation spies.

303
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,750
But that means the mechanist is a--

304
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,750
Traitor.

305
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,541
Come on.

306
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,666
The mechanist
has been working for the Fire Nation,

307
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,833
building devices, selling secrets.

308
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,458
Sokka and Aang. They're in danger.

309
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,541
-I've gotta warn them.
-They'll be fine.

310
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,208
The mechanist may be a turncoat,
but he's a coward.

311
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,375
He'd never take any direct action.

312
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,125
This one, on the other hand…

313
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,666
Wait.

314
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,791
Who are you?

315
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,625
They call me Jet.

316
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,666
Yeah!

317
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,250
They're flying!

318
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,416
Look at that!

319
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,125
There's the cave.

320
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:29,000
Your pursuit was so clumsy,
I wasn't sure you'd ever catch up.

321
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,375
Big talk for someone who's outnumbered.

322
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,750
Good thing I brought friends then.

323
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,083
Oh yeah. I brought friends too.

324
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,125
Hey, buddy.

325
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,666
Awesome shooting there, Longshot.

326
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,958
That was a mean swing, Pipsqueak.

327
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,250
Nice moves. I had a feeling
you knew how to handle yourself.

328
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,500
-Really?
-Cool attack on that flamehead.

329
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,625
Thanks, Pipsqueak.

330
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,291
-He's The Duke. I'm Pipsqueak.
-Oh.

331
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,916
It's great to have a Waterbender
on our side.

332
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,250
Who are you people?

333
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,625
We're the good guys.

334
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,458
Oh.

335
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,125
Where's he taking him?

336
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,833
Don't worry. Pipsqueak knows
how to take out the garbage.

337
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,333
You coming?

338
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,583
And if you add plates here
and a vent here,

339
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,583
all you need to do is install
a bleed valve to regulate pressure.

340
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,583
And you're saying you implemented this
with water-based transportation?

341
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,166
Well, no, it's just an idea I had

342
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,625
to make our ice-dodging ships
more maneuverable.

343
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,625
Oh.

344
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,791
Very clever.
Your father must be proud of you.

345
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:08,166
Yeah, um, Dad doesn't really pay attention
to stuff like this.

346
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:12,291
He's got more important things
to worry about. He's a warrior.

347
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,416
The world is filled with warriors.

348
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,208
But there are far too few great engineers.

349
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,250
Engineer?

350
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,916
No, this is just a hobby.

351
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,750
My, uh… my role is to protect the village
and be a warrior, just like Dad.

352
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,083
Protecting the ones we love is important,

353
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,125
but I also know we must pursue
the talents that we've been given.

354
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,708
Sokka, you're a gifted engineer.
Don't ignore that.

355
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:45,083
It's not always easy to find your path
in life, but when you find it,

356
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,583
you must embrace it.

357
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,916
People who saw the bombings
also saw a burst of green flame.

358
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,416
Tincar salt burns green.

359
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,291
It's a mineral tanners use
to cure animal skins.

360
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,375
They came up here
to dig it out of the mountain.

361
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,833
Just stuff I picked up from my dad.

362
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,083
-He must be really proud of you.
-I guess so.

363
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,916
I think he sometimes wishes
I was more like him.

364
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,583
Don't get me wrong. He's incredible.

365
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:17,000
After the Fire Nation
attacked our village,

366
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,416
he kept us alive.

367
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,875
He built our life here.

368
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,750
He's always said
that it's just me and him,

369
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,583
and he'd do anything to protect us.

370
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,333
And you want him to do more.

371
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:31,375
I want him to see that we have to do
everything we can to save the world

372
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,458
because if not us, then who?

373
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,125
Welcome.

374
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,750
I'm almost there!

375
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,083
Come on.

376
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,541
Whoo!

377
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:56,916
You live here?

378
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,958
We've had a few bases,
but this one's served us well.

379
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:00,916
Yeah! Come on!

380
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,166
Firebenders haven't been able
to track us here.

381
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,875
I still don't understand what Firebenders
are doing in the Earth Kingdom city.

382
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,791
Well, Omashu isn't what it used to be.

383
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,208
In the old days, the city stood strong,
but as the war dragged on,

384
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,583
the king lost his nerve,
grew tired, senile.

385
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:23,625
Let corruption spring up all around him.
Fire Nation seeped in through the cracks.

386
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,125
That's where we come in.

387
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,791
So you just took it on yourselves
to fight the Firebenders?

388
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,833
Well, if not us, then who?

389
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:36,458
Everyone here
has lost someone to the Fire Nation.

390
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,875
Families. Loved ones.

391
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,875
We're orphans, refugees.

392
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,500
At least, that's what we were.

393
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,083
What are we now, Smellerbee?

394
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,208
Freedom fighters!

395
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,625
Yeah!

396
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,375
Someone was here recently.

397
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,875
Here, look.

398
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,958
If you mix tincar with salt water
and then boil it down, you get this.

399
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,041
Blasting jelly.

400
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,791
A few jars
could blow half the neighborhood sky-high.

401
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,625
What is it? What did you find?

402
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,000
The Firebenders
weren't behind the explosion.

403
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,875
My mother was
the fighter in our family.

404
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:54,416
She taught me the blade,
which, back then, was just a stick.

405
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,958
When the Fire Nation came to our village,
she held them off while

406
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,625
my dad hid me in a well.

407
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:08,500
I wanted to fight,
but… he wouldn't let me.

408
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:11,416
I was eight.

409
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,041
And when I came back up…

410
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,958
they were all gone.

411
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,125
I know what it's like
to lose family too.

412
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,250
It was quiet… the night my mom died.

413
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,000
Until the soldiers came.

414
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,083
I try not to think about it.
But recently, it's been coming back to me.

415
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,125
I think it's been affecting my bending.

416
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,875
I don't know anything about bending,
but I do know

417
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:36,458
that you have to use
everything inside you to help you fight.

418
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,333
Tell me, what do you remember
when you think of your mother?

419
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,291
I don't mean how she died.
I mean when she was alive.

420
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,125
I remember

421
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,333
her getting up every morning
before everyone else.

422
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,625
I remember

423
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,708
seeing her outside the hut,

424
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,625
getting to work, preparing breakfast.

425
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,708
And every day,

426
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,833
she would stop when the sun rose.

427
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,083
She would watch it and smile.

428
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,500
Every day.

429
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:29,916
Remember that.

430
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,583
Remember the sunrise.

431
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,916
We don't have to be afraid of our pain.

432
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,666
We just need to decide
what we're gonna do with it.

433
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,583
- What are you doing?
- Trying some Omashu barbecue.

434
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,708
It's not often you get the opportunity.

435
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:56,333
This is the great Omashu,
the best the Earth Kingdom has to offer?

436
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,333
I gather its charms are lost on you.

437
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:02,708
"Charm"?

438
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:04,833
You mean the dirt, the noise, the…

439
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,916
the stench?

440
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,583
- Thank you.
- What happened there?

441
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:21,166
I'm told that Fire Nation agents
in the city have taken to sowing terror

442
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,875
to weaken the Earthbenders' resistance.

443
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,708
That's not right. Warriors don't hide
their faces in a fight.

444
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,416
Father would never approve
of this underhanded tactic.

445
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,625
Given how long this war has lasted,

446
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,041
who knows where true north lies
in the Fire Nation?

447
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,958
<i>It has come to my attention</i>
<i>you are involved in a matter</i>

448
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,416
<i>vital to the safety of our empire.</i>

449
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,416
<i>I'd be in your debt</i>
<i>if you kept me informed</i>

450
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,458
<i>on the progress of your mission,</i>
<i>particularly as it relates to Prince Zuko.</i>

451
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,875
<i>In return, I will keep in mind</i>
<i>your loyalty and cooperation</i>

452
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,458
<i>when the time comes</i>
<i>for such debts to be paid,</i>

453
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:02,000
<i>a time that may arrive</i>
<i>sooner than expected.</i>

454
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,291
<i>To the Flame Eternal. Princess Azula.</i>

455
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,333
Good news?

456
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:12,750
The best.

457
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,291
It may have taken a while, Lt. Dang,
but we are finally in the big game.

458
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:22,416
You know the officer
on Prince Zuko's crew,

459
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,416
the one who slipped you
the information about the Avatar?

460
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,666
Lieutenant Jee.

461
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,583
I'd like to speak to him.

462
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,250
Sir.

463
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,625
-Sokka!
-Aang, check this out.

464
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,541
Where's Katara?

465
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:49,333
Uh, I haven't seen her all day.
I was helping Sai with his airship model.

466
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,833
He just left to show it to the generals
at the palace. Why? What is it?

467
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,083
Teo and I found where the bombers
have been getting their explosives.

468
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,875
They're making blasting jelly
in a cave up on the mountain.

469
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,083
Blasting jelly?

470
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:06,500
That's not all. We also found these.
The robes from the turnip cart.

471
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,916
So it wasn't the Firebenders
behind the explosion? It was--

472
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,916
You're not gonna believe this.
I know who's behind the bombings.

473
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,333
What?

474
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,166
-No, Jet's not the bad guy. Sai is.
-Are you kidding me?

475
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,833
Sai has done nothing but help us.
Jet's a con artist who lied to our faces.

476
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:27,500
-He didn't lie.
-He didn't tell the truth.

477
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,875
Because he couldn't!

478
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,875
He's fighting the Firebenders,
and he has to protect himself.

479
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,708
You don't know what he's already lost.

480
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,083
Besides, I saw Sai talking
to the Firebender. He's the traitor.

481
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,583
You don't know what you saw!

482
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,125
For all we know, Sai could be working
with the king's men to root out spies.

483
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,458
He's headed to the palace right now.
He could be reporting everything.

484
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,083
-You're wrong!
-This is just like you, Katara!

485
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,583
Willing to believe anything
as long as it helps you!

486
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:56,583
This is just like you!
Never believing anything I say!

487
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,958
I'm sick of you
treating me like I'm a little girl!

488
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,083
Then grow up!

489
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,500
Where are you going?

490
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,500
To prove you're a jerk!

491
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,666
Oh yeah?
Well, I don't need proof for that!

492
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,125
Oh!

493
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,416
-Would you like to try one of my--
-Not right now.

494
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,583
Jet.

495
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:44,166
-Listen, we need to talk.
-Sure.

496
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,250
Later. We just launched a big mission.
Things might get hot for us around here.

497
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,958
Mission? What mission?

498
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,500
<i>You were there when we confirmed</i>
<i>the mechanist was a traitor.</i>

499
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,416
<i>We took care of his partners.</i>
<i>Now, I need to take care of him.</i>

500
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Jet, what are you gonna do?

501
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,083
I told you.

502
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,833
We know how to take out the garbage.

503
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,583
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

504
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,416
- I'm so clumsy. Are you hurt?
- No.

505
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,041
-No harm done. No harm done.
-Okay.

506
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,375
Okay.

507
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,208
<i>You're going to blow him up?</i>

508
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,750
Not just him.
He's got an audience with the king.

509
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,541
This is our chance
to burn out this city's diseased heart.

510
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,416
Sokka was right. You are the bad guy.

511
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,333
Katara.

512
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,791
The warehouse we destroyed,
that was a meeting spot for spies.

513
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,583
And by flushing them out,
we got those three yesterday.

514
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,333
The mechanist will help us
root out even more evil.

515
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,375
Innocent people are gonna die, Jet!

516
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,666
That's the price of freedom.

517
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,166
Katara!

518
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,500
It's too late!

519
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,166
There's nothing you can do to stop it!

520
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,333
You were right.

521
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,833
Shut up and gloat later.
Right now, we need to stop Sai.

522
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,041
Jet planted a bomb on him.

523
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,625
What's the fastest way to the palace?

524
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,416
It's at the highest point in the city,
so we need to--

525
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
This guy? Again?

526
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,958
Go. Get to the palace and stop Sai.

527
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,708
This is my fight.

528
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,708
Keep your firebending in check,

529
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,208
or you'll have the Earth Kingdom Army
to deal with.

530
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,958
I don't need fire to defeat this boy.

531
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,000
Ah!

532
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,375
Ah.

533
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,416
Watch out! Excuse me!

534
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,583
I have an idea. Come on.

535
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,875
- Ah!
- Huh!

536
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:12,250
How dare you hit that child?

537
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,291
Ah!

538
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,708
Sai said all routes lead to the palace.

539
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,958
We have to take this one
to the end of the line.

540
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,916
The end of the line may be coming soon.

541
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:58,083
Ready? One, two, three! Ah!

542
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:14,791
Stand and fight!

543
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,375
For what? Why is this so important to you?

544
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,333
You're an enemy of the Fire Nation.

545
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,833
And that's it? That's why you've been
hunting me for three years?

546
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,625
How do you know it's been three years?

547
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,416
Unless…

548
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,041
You have my notebook!

549
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,833
A Firebender!

550
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,791
A Firebender!

551
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:43,375
My… my… my cabbages!

552
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:58,791
Oh no!

553
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,541
Protect the king!

554
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,250
We must leave!

555
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,625
Now!

556
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,458
It's a Firebender!

557
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:08,083
Find the Firebender,
and close the gate!

558
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,750
-Go! Save yourself!
-What?

559
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,458
For the Fire Nation!

560
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,458
Uh-oh.
