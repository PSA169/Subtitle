3
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,619
You want us to wait?

4
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:35,173
I'll catch up.

5
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:16,145
Jace?

6
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:17,939
Fuck.

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,527
Nope!

8
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:21,840
No fucking way, guys!

9
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,462
I'm not doing this!

10
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,400
Stop.

11
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:44,207
Okay! Okay!

12
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,109
Jace?

13
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,559
Bradford?

14
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,018
Holy fucking shit.

15
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,504
How long can you
scream like that?

16
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,265
No. Hold up. Stop.

17
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,715
Like, how long can you do
that in a night

18
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,062
without needing, like, a
break or something?

19
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:47,719
Uh, probably a few hours.

20
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,272
'Kay.

21
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,999
And underwear? You
fine working in just underwear?

22
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,069
Yeah.

23
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,450
This isn't sexual
harassment.

24
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:55,209
She knows that.
- Yeah, that's not a problem.

25
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,521
'Kay. Blood?

26
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,212
You fine with blood?
- Yeah. Great.

27
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,248
Like a shitload
of blood, though,

28
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:00,421
like, gallons of it.

29
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,664
The more the merrier.

30
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:03,286
All right.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,737
Let's show her how to die.

32
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,326
So you're actually
going to be filling in

33
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:09,775
for someone who flaked on us.

34
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,260
You fine to start us today?

35
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,296
I don't think I'm wearing
the right underwear for that.

36
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:14,539
I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

37
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:15,954
We've got plenty
for you to pick from.

38
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,680
I've been filling in for her
since she ditched us,

39
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,234
but I'm primarily
the makeup artist, so, eh.

40
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,753
This is all part time
and seasonal

41
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,927
so sometimes
people just disappear.

42
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:26,033
And Bradford doesn't look
super convincing in a bra,

43
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,379
so there's that.

44
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,209
When'd you see me in a bra?
I look amazing in a bra.

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,245
It's kind of a weird time
for you to jump in.

46
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,833
There's only a couple of days
left in the season,

47
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,628
but if you can fill in for
just those couple of days,

48
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,629
that'd be awesome.

49
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,078
Yeah.
That sounds good.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,079
You went to
theater school?

51
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,495
- DePaul, yeah.
- Okay, great.

52
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,082
It's basically the same thing
as putting up a show,

53
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,429
instead of eight performances
a week

54
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,465
you're doing 40 performances
in a night,

55
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:45,708
one every couple of minutes.

56
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:46,985
But the lines are a lot
easier to remember

57
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:48,642
because it's just a bunch
of fucking screaming.

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,782
Yeah. Backstage should feel
pretty familiar, too.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,508
We're just a bunch of theater
kids who never grew up

60
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:53,371
and got real jobs.

61
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,648
Everybody's flirtatious,

62
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:56,443
but it's a summer camp,
kind of flirtatious,

63
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,168
so it should be
completely harmless

64
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,723
if, for whatever reason,
it doesn't feel harmless

65
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,483
you come to one of us
immediately.

66
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,381
Yeah.

67
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,623
Long story short, no touching.

68
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,107
They don't touch you.
We don't touch them.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,833
They do touch you.
Yell "Pervo!"

70
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,456
We're coming running.
- Pervo?

71
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:10,595
Yeah. It was carefully
chosen.

72
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,665
Took us a long time
to get there.

73
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:12,976
Speaking of which,
we got to go.

74
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm going to be in
there with you

75
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,116
the whole time.

76
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:15,979
Nobody will get anywhere
near you.

77
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,084
He's not that big,

78
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,327
but he does have a table
full of weapons.

79
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,432
I'm big enough.
Plus, weapons.

80
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,951
And I'm a
fucking ghoul.

81
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,545
Blood!
Guts!

82
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,788
All right,
everybody, this is Matilda.

83
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,652
She's going to be our new
scalpee for the night.

84
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,171
It's her first time
at a haunted house,

85
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,483
so let's be nice to her.

86
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,898
But she's got a
hell of a scream,

87
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,209
so just show her
what to do, all right?

88
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:40,935
Taylor's only been gone
a couple days.

89
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,316
Okay.

90
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,284
And if she shows up, we'll
find her something to do.

91
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:45,388
She loves being scalped.

92
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:46,665
Okay, but Rosemary doesn't.

93
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,046
And I need someone who
can scream,

94
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,772
and I found someone who can
scream. So let's be nice,

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,876
okay?

96
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:52,533
Anyway, guys, we got
a to haunt open.

97
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,604
Why're we just
sitting around?

98
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,612
Hey, it's not her fault.

99
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,822
Taylor took off.

100
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,459
Bachelor of Fine Arts.

101
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,705
Okay.

102
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,815
Like a glove.

103
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,264
Yeah.

104
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:36,059
So do you have any double-
sided tape for this glove?

105
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,510
I'm worried I'm going to start
thrashing around and it's all

106
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:40,685
gonna pop out.
- I got you covered.

107
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,687
Figuratively.

108
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,008
Here's your chair.

109
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,044
Oh.

110
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,841
And here is your hair.

111
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:00,808
Oh.

112
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:04,605
And I think it's probably
going to match...

113
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:05,537
Yes!

114
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:06,573
There we go.

115
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,368
Awesome. Okay.

116
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:11,716
So...

117
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,926
Basically, when he scalps
you, he's going to

118
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,030
lift this part up.

119
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,273
Oh, yuck.

120
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,792
I will goop it up more.

121
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,725
Oh, nice, okay.

122
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,347
Boop, boop, boop.

123
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,108
Okay, you're done.
- Awesome.

124
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:02,525
You can sit out in the hall,
we will come and get you

125
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:03,664
when we're ready
to place you.

126
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,114
Awesome. Thank you.

127
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,426
How we
doing over here?

128
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,612
Has anyone
seen my heart?

129
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,101
- You're missing out.
- What about, like, beans?

130
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,657
It seems as though
someone has stolen my heart.

131
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,937
and hopefully they're single
and emotionally available.

132
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,149
Thanks, Pumpkin.

133
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,291
We can make it work.

134
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,375
Ping! Ping!

135
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,038
One! Two! Three!

136
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,216
Let's go!

137
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,901
Little chilly tonight,
huh, bud?

138
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,352
Lemme help you out?

139
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,736
There you go.

140
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,200
Great door scare.

141
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,202
You clearly work here.

142
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,342
What the fuck?

143
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,456
It is time to open
this haunted house!

144
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,776
This is what we live for!

145
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,403
Tonight, we give the people
what they want.

146
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,820
And what they want...

147
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,064
is blood and...

148
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:42,858
Guts!

149
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,204
- Blood!
- Guts!

150
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,585
- Blood!
- Guts!

151
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,965
- Blood!
- Guts!

152
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:48,933
- Blood!
- Guts!

153
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,451
Let's open
this haunt!

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,015
Let's go!
Let's go!

155
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,880
â™ª IT'S HALLOWEEN â™ª
by First of October

156
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,909
Could this one
be a little tighter?

157
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,496
Yeah.

158
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,811
Just let me know if you
need a break or anything.

159
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,157
Yeah. For sure.

160
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,400
You know what to do?

161
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:43,470
I start screaming
when you start cutting.

162
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,817
Hey, have a
good first night.

163
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:46,749
It's not my
first night.

164
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:48,026
Thanks.

165
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:49,131
It's really weird
you don't recognize me.

166
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,166
Don't get too
comfortable, Rook'.

167
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,236
Not a rookie.

168
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:52,203
I was in the room
when we hired you.

169
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:53,722
I think she was
talking to me.

170
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,964
Oh, she was being a bitch?

171
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:55,862
Yeah.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,208
Aww. Thank you.

173
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,744
Oh! Okay.

174
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,193
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

175
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:18,712
They can't touch us, right?

176
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:27,548
Welcome to
Realm of Terror.

177
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:34,486
Oh.

178
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:38,939
Does my scarecrow
not scare you?

179
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,492
Come on, Scarecrow.

180
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,184
Scare these people.

181
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,187
Rawr.

182
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:46,602
Oh.

183
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,017
Still not scared.

184
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,260
We can do better than that.

185
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:51,538
Let's help him out.

186
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,369
Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:03,377
It appears it's time for
you to hurry in

188
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,655
before my associates

189
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:09,073
start looking
for another scarecrow.

190
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,351
I hear a post

191
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,733
has recently opened up.

192
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,458
Of course,

193
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,460
I wouldn't want
to tie you to...

194
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,877
...anything.

195
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,606
How many?

196
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,298
Two, please.

197
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,474
You just graduated?

198
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:32,475
Yeah.

199
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,581
You part of any
theater groups?

200
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,790
I was at a troupe in school,
but after graduation

201
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,447
we all kinda scattered.

202
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:40,069
Chicago's a theater town.

203
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,002
That's what I said,

204
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,521
but the theater kids
headed east

205
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,488
and the screen kids
headed west.

206
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,974
Didn't feel like chasing
the big time?

207
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,528
Well, I mean,
we just graduated.

208
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,047
I mean, why is everyone so
eager to dive

209
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,324
into the deep end?

210
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,360
I mean, can't we take
a second to breathe?

211
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,121
Or get chained to walls?

212
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:58,432
Right.

213
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,709
I thought we got a year
to, like, chill out

214
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,435
and see if we were
actually cut out for this.

215
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,024
And they all just
kind of left me, so...

216
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,406
now I gotta find a new
group of weirdoes

217
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,821
to hang out with.

218
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:08,788
Well...

219
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:09,512
you've come to
the right place.

220
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,928
Right?

221
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,312
All right. Show time.

222
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,141
Okay.

223
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:22,284
Here we go.

224
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,988
Oh! More beautiful scalps!

225
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,271
Whoa.

226
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,170
- Pretty great, right?
- Holy shit.

227
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,379
Dude, double high fives.
Come on.

228
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,001
- Um...
- Come on. You can do it.

229
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,522
- I can't do it.
- No, that's good. Here.

230
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:57,215

â™ª WE'RE CHEAP ALREADY â™ª
by Driftless Pony Club

232
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,172
You killed it!

233
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,587
- No.
- Yes. You're a scream queen!

234
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,279
- Stop.
- You fucking killed it! Yes!

235
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,937
Sounds like you
killed it.

236
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,077
I guess. Yeah.

237
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:41,630
I mean, you doing that?

238
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,494
Oh, no,
not the big screaming stuff.

239
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:44,495
I'm no good at that.

240
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,946
I make a much better body
in a tub

241
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,430
with long slit wrists,

242
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:51,122
laying still, occasionally
twitching, splashing people.

243
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:52,882
That I can sell, but

244
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,471
we got rid of the suicide
tub years ago.

245
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,163
Bradford enjoys performing

246
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:59,510
as much as he likes
running this place.

247
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:01,305
If he had boobs, we probably
could have

248
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,789
ridden out the season.

249
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,549
- Fair enough.
- Your scalp, my dear.

250
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,310
Be kind.
- Thank you. Yes, I will.

251
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,725
So are the fitting rooms

252
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:09,071
first come first serve
at the end of the night or...

253
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,659
For those that bother
with them.

254
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:11,522
What?

255
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,937
Hey! Picture!

256
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,042
There's always a few.

257
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,667
In three, two, one.

258
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,361
Yeah. That's great, guys.
Thanks.

259
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,328
Good, good, good.

260
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:25,812
You don't mind, do you?

261
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,055
No.
I admire the confidence.

262
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,747
- No. The picture.
- Oh!

263
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,370
They love their post-haunt,
half-makeup, naked stuff.

264
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,820
No, no. I don't mind.

265
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,373
Almost 80 thousand
followers, too.

266
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,685
Sweet.

267
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,031
Yeah, I got to keep it
nipple free, though.

268
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,240
Well, I mean, you gotta
leash those nips sometimes.

269
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:42,070
Double standard.
Right, Jace?

270
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,485
Oh, I could go full nip.

271
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:45,659
God, there's two of you.

272
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,247
Yeah, this year.

273
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,042
Last year there were, like,
what, four of us?

274
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,733
Five if Julie had
a couple drinks.

275
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,252
Oh yeah.

276
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,772
How many Instagram
followers do you have?

277
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,395
Oh, no. I don't do it
for the 'gram.

278
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,535
Yeah. No pics out when
the dick's out.

279
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:01,089
Jace is all lifestyle.

280
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,125
You don't mind, do you?

281
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,369
Fly free, mon ami.

282
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,267
- I like you.
- Fly free!

283
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,062
- Mika!
- I told you, bro.

284
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,719
That's why butcher shops
keep their finest meat

285
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:11,754
behind glass.

286
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,102
It's not meat.
It's muscle.

287
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,587
Tell me about it.

288
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,246
Hey, Jace. Is this
your phone.

289
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:21,730
Did you still my
fucking phone?

290
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,042
Put your clothes on, man.

291
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,250
We could hear you from
outside.

292
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,321
- Really?
- You sure can scream.

293
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,977
I mean, it's fun.

294
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,979
- Are you exhausted?
- I mean, I'm all right.

295
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:32,051
There's a place we hang out
after if you want to come?

296
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,604
Oh, yo, Seth.

297
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:36,124
What was going on in
there tonight?

298
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,573
They tell you what I said?

299
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:38,954
Yeah, I heard what you said.
That's the whole thing.

300
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,473
You don't have a head,
you can't talk.

301
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:41,577
That's why it's funny.

302
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:42,785
I was like, "Hey--

303
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,649
Hey, just take it off.

304
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:45,754
I saw you screwing around
with your

305
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:46,893
head knife over there.

306
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,239
Sure. Back here.

307
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:49,240
Back here we can make all the

308
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:50,552
"Oh, Gimme head" jokes
you want.

309
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,794
In there, you stay
in character.

310
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,279
In character?

311
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,350
I'm a decapitated football
player with a pom pom head.

312
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,420
Who cares if I talk?

313
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:58,042
- I care if you talk.
- It's fake.

314
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,941
It's only fake
if you don't believe it.

315
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,978
Actually, you know what, Seth?

316
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,601
Don't bother
coming back tomorrow.

317
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:18,994
Fucking stop.

318
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,479
I just wiped all this
shit off.

319
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,508
Yo, did you see who dropped
this phone?

320
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,165
Not mine.

321
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,309
Have you heard anything
from Taylor?

322
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:00,484
- Mika--
- No, I'm not doing that.

323
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:01,588
I just found her phone here.

324
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,004
But she texted me to
meet her here?

325
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,455
No, I haven't gotten
anything from her.

326
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,008
But if she turns up,
we'll find her something.

327
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:08,975
I promise.

328
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,114
Are you going to be here
a while?

329
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:11,046
Yeah, I'll be here.

330
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,012
Text me if she shows up.

331
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,704
Yeah, sure.

332
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,538
Just...

333
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,540
Yep. Just put it
on the floor.

334
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,887
Sheese, Rook'. Do you ever
clean out your car?

335
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,199
I mean, I'm getting there.

336
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,375
It's like you drove
through a thrift store

337
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,377
with your windows open.

338
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,448
You are going to say
something nice to her

339
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,381
before the end of the night.
- We'll see.

340
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,623
No, I mean, it's okay.

341
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:37,590
Her shitty attitude is like
the North Star of

342
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:39,178
my haunt experience.

343
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:40,972
It's one thing
I know I can count on.

344
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,353
No shit. Okay.

345
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,909
Fuckin' haunt actors.

346
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,067
Fuck!

347
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,761
I thought everybody
was already out of here.

348
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,832
Tonight is the first night
I'm not exhausted from

349
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,766
screaming my ass off
for three hours.

350
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,768
I thought I'd get a
jump on the laundry.

351
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:55,668
You could do that tomorrow
when we could go to the party.

352
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,428
I want to bring them a
couple cases of beer anyway,

353
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,050
it was a good week.

354
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,086
You go ahead.

355
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,606
You're not going to come?

356
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,436
It's kind of starting
to feel a little...

357
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,645
- College'y?
- Yeah.

358
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,509
Well, you know, that's
one of the perks of the job,

359
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:10,959
you never got to grow up.

360
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:12,685
Do you remember
me in college?

361
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,307
I locked myself in my dorm,

362
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,309
ate nachos, and watched
Elm Street movies.

363
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,104
Well, that's another
perk of the job,

364
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,692
you can make up for lost time.

365
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,521
Kinda feeling like nachos.

366
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,387
I'll come to the wrap party,
I promise.

367
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,802
Okay.

368
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,079
You want me to come by later?

369
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:29,598
If you want to.

370
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,290
Okay. Well, don't
work too hard.

371
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:33,257
Just because it's
hard work...

372
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:36,329
...doesn't mean
it's not fun.

373
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,843
You're good.

374
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:26,034
The fu--

375
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:29,313
Fuck! Fuck!

376
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:57,134
Hey, Siri, call 911!

377
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:58,091
Oh!

378
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,356
Fuck!

379
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:29,079
I'm sorry.
Where are we?

380
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:30,563
Tall John's lake house.

381
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,565
He lets a couple of us stay
here on haunt weekends

382
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,878
so we don't have to go
all the way back to the city.

383
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,638
Tall John?
You saw him.

384
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:39,054
I think he was spiky head guy
by the end of the night.

385
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:40,884
He's been at the haunt
for forever.

386
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,955
So his place has always been
the after-party.

387
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:43,921
Cool.

388
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,302
He never hangs out
with us.

389
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,407
I always try, but he
never goes for it.

390
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,202
Aww, that's okay.

391
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,999
She met up with Jace?

392
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,281
Yeah, the haunt is
so much fun,

393
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,319
but honestly, the Halloween
bump it gives my Only Fans

394
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,285
is even better.

395
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:04,528
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,150
And it boosts the Instagram
ad' rev' to.

397
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,049
- Oh, you do sponsorships?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:10,223
Umm... Makeup.
Goth lingerie.

399
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,984
Prosthetic fangs.

400
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:13,433
Whoa. That's so cool.

401
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,711
How does it work?

402
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,575
Oh, it just slides
right in and right out.

403
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:17,714
'ey...

404
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,129
You did not.

405
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,027
I did. Always. Always.

406
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,064
I did a couple of seasons
at the theme park, but

407
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:25,273
it's just a sanitized version
of what we're doing.

408
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:28,103
And the budget's great. Great
costumes and makeup, but...

409
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,761
It's the board-approved
assembly-line version

410
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,314
all packaged and ready
to appear

411
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,144
on souvenir cups.

412
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,284
It's all so cutesy.

413
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:38,424
All of Halloween has
gotten so fucking cutesy.

414
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:39,287
You know?

415
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,772
I mean, at least we're we're
doing has a little bit

416
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,981
of edge, but 2,000 years ago,
they were setting people

417
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,017
on fire, dude.

418
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,019
You really wanna talk about
going face to face

419
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:48,607
with the darkness?

420
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:49,987
No, not really.

421
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:51,713
Yeah. No duh.

422
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,958
The penis has been
vilified in our society.

423
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:55,855
That's all I'm saying.

424
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:56,960
Okay.

425
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,720
Like it's literally seen
as a weapon.

426
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,446
You don't think that's
because it's been used as

427
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:03,311
a weapon for so long
by so many?

428
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,519
I think we can both agree

429
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,865
that it's disproportionate, though.

430
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,833
I mean, people are stabbed
with pens all the time.

431
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,835
But pens aren't stigmatized
as weapons.

432
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,630
You don't think it's
because less people

433
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:15,461
get stabbed by pens than
women get raped by penises?

434
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,496
Okay.

435
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,188
Okay.

436
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:19,534
Honestly, I just thought you
were a hot guy with a really

437
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,192
nice body who liked to
hang brain here and there,

438
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,297
but it turns out you're
making a point.

439
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,644
Congrats.

440
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,404
I'm taking it back.

441
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:30,372
- Your comment?
- I'm reclaiming the penis.

442
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,754
It's exposure therapy.

443
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,515
You just admitted that it's
publicly accepted

444
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,620
as a weapon.

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,347
I mean, all these other guys
are concealed carry,

446
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:41,556
yours is out in the open.

447
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:44,663
I'm trying to give you
a positive experience with it.

448
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,080
What's it going to do,
stir my drink for me?

449
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:49,840
It can.

450
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,842
How did I know you were
gonna say that?

451
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,705
It can!

452
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:54,051
I'm sure I can.

453
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:56,329
All right. Your loss.

454
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:04,337
So what kind of you?

455
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:06,961
Kind?

456
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:11,655
Are you an exhibitionist
or a theater kid?

457
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:12,691
Neither.

458
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:14,520
So what's your thing?

459
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,005
I'm either gonna chase
people around

460
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:18,213
with a fake chainsaw

461
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,078
or I'm gonna chase
them around

462
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,183
with the real one.

463
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,117
Oh.

464
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,399
He doesn't even want
anyone to have fun.

465
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:32,641
Fuck it.

466
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,781
I make more money at the
escape room anyway.

467
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,609
I was only doing this
because

468
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:35,714
it was supposed to be fun.

469
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:36,887
You work at the
escape room?

470
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,717
Yeah. 60 to Escape.

471
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,580
Where people know
that it's a game.

472
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,720
And we're not treating
goofball shit

473
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,031
like it's Shakespeare.

474
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,309
That room doesn't even

475
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:46,517
need a decapitated
football player.

476
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:47,587
Fuck it.

477
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:52,075
But we still get to come
to these parties, right?

478
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:54,180
- Probably, yeah.
- Right on.

479
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:55,734
'Cause this is my shit, dude.

480
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,425
Can I ask you something?

481
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,910
Why are women always
the ones who have to be

482
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:00,877
chained up and die?

483
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,188
Because it's classic.

484
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,811
It's like Herschell
Gordon Lewis.

485
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,674
Okay, yeah,
but I want to torture, dude.

486
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,193
I mean, ask
any girl in this room.

487
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,574
They'd love to see
a lady ghoul

488
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,127
scalping a half naked guy.

489
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,957
Sure, but it's a trope.
It's classic.

490
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:14,476
Okay, well, don't be classic.
Be original.

491
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:15,719
It's not about
being original.

492
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,134
We're a haunt, like...

493
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:18,618
nobody wants what's
in my brain.

494
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,172
They want blood,
they want guts.

495
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,967
They want clowns
with chainsaws

496
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:23,451
and chicks
chained to the walls.

497
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:24,763
They want what they know.

498
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,143
You give them what they know.
They love it.

499
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,111
They love it. They love us.

500
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,491
Yeah, but isn't it
more important

501
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,735
to move the conversation
a little bit forward?

502
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,428
It's more important
for making money.

503
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,120
It's about sex, isn't it?

504
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,673
Totally.

505
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:44,437
Y'all good?

506
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,956
Anyone need anything?

507
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:48,510
Tall John! Where have you
been all night?

508
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:49,753
Come hang out with us.

509
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:50,892
I'm good.

510
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,791
Give me a shout if you
need anything.

511
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:56,035
Come hang out.

512
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,107
V. V.
V, V, V. V, V, V, V, V, V, V.

513
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:07,081
And you have to hold my leg.

514
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,841
Like this?

515
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:09,842
Yes!

516
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,309
You having fun?

517
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,831
Anybody slip anything
in your drink?

518
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,317
Do you want them to?

519
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,044
No, I'm good.

520
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,253
Mika doesn't really
hate you.

521
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:43,220
She's just nervous.

522
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,429
I'm not trying
to replace her friend.

523
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,192
I think she liked her.

524
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,849
Liked her liked her?

525
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:53,679
They were pretty all over
each other.

526
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,371
Not Jace?

527
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,511
Probably him too.

528
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,549
But he's kind of too hot for
anybody to be serious about.

529
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:03,585
He's like...

530
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:05,760
the IRL version of the poster
you hang in your bedroom

531
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,900
when you're too young to
know better.

532
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,696
I think she's just looking
for someone to blame.

533
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,112
Try not to take it
personal in the meantime.

534
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,044
Yeah.

535
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,943
I won't.

536
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:18,531
Mmm...

537
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,740
So what kind are you?

538
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,845
What kind of what?

539
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,295
Are you a theater kid?

540
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,675
Are you an exhibitionist?

541
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,919
Are you a psychopath?

542
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,403
I just do the fun stuff.

543
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,681
This is my Halloween
thing.

544
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:33,477
I help people with light
displays on Christmas.

545
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:36,032
Handmake really elaborate
valentines.

546
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,585
Get drunk as fuck on
New Year's?

547
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:38,413
You know it.

548
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,725
What about you?

549
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,451
Oh, I also get drunk
as fuck on New Year's.

550
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,177
But are you a naked
or a psycho?

551
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,110
Oh, no, no.
I'm a theater kid.

552
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,318
How did you find us?

553
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,596
The top listing on
castingchicago.com.

554
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:49,700
Big time.

555
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:51,219
Yeah, no,

556
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:52,393
I'm still trying to hear back
from a few student shorts.

557
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:54,705
Thoughts and prayers.

558
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:56,742
Thank you.

559
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,021
I don't care if anything
happened between

560
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,195
the two of you.

561
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:02,230
I didn't write those.

562
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:03,714
It came from your phone.

563
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:05,509
Well, I lost my phone
for, like, a week.

564
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:07,097
And then Tall John
found it tonight.

565
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,548
- Let me see your texts.
- Okay.

566
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:10,411
Hey, yo, Danny.

567
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:11,550
Oh.

568
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:12,275
Can you get my phone
out of my pants?

569
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,586
Yeah.

570
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,347
Tell me again how you
misplaced your phone?

571
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:24,597
Yeah, see, I don't
got those.

572
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,221
I only send Taylor
GIFs anyways.

573
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,464
Have you seen this one?

574
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:31,121
Yeah.

575
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,400
Yeah, so you think Taylor's
into me?

576
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:40,096
I'll take that as a maybe.

577
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,167
So you think somebody
else sent the texts.

578
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:43,892
The same night
she disappeared.

579
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,308
Oooh.

580
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,689
And you think she disappeared?

581
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,968
Or the last night
she was at the haunt.

582
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:51,831
Like...
disappeared disappeared?

583
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,593
I don't know, that sounds
dumb, but it's weird, right?

584
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,664
Disappeeeeared.

585
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:57,596
Yeah.

586
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,184
That is pretty weird, though.

587
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:00,909
It's not that weird.

588
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:02,497
It's the haunt.

589
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,085
Like, some people
get sick of the makeup.

590
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,053
Other people are just in it
for the money.

591
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,503
Some people just take ghosting
a little too seriously.

592
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,196
The point is, it happens
literally all the time.

593
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,646
Josh was MIA from
autopsy tonight, too.

594
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:14,923
No, I saw Josh.

595
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,408
No, Carley said he was
a no-show.

596
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,686
Okay, well, someone sends me
a message from her phone,

597
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:19,998
then ditches it when
I call it?

598
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:21,551
Like, who would do that
and why?

599
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:22,655
Who would do it?

600
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,347
And for what
nefarious porpoise?

601
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:25,589
- Danny...
- Yeah.

602
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,143
And why does someone
even have her phone?

603
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,386
Maybe it was Taylor.

604
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,078
Than why ditch the phone?

605
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:32,113
Yeah.

606
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:34,288
You shoulda just stayed
at the haunt tonight.

607
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:35,841
I mean, maybe your
mysterious texter

608
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:36,669
hung around.

609
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,533
Fuck no, dude. By myself?

610
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:39,983
No, you wouldn't have
been by yourself.

611
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,157
You know what?

612
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,710
I bet Rosemary is probably
still there.

613
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:44,746
We can go back.
Danny, you want to come with?

614
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,714
I would like to stay at
the party, please.

615
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:48,957
No. Yeah, forget it.
It's fine.

616
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,373
No, come on.
You and me, we can go.

617
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:51,926
No, like, I'm sure
some of this is like

618
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,307
a moonlight mindfuck.

619
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:55,861
I'm sure it'll make
more sense in the daytime.

620
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,104
Come on.

621
00:33:57,242 --> 00:34:00,003
I don't want you feeling
weird about my haunt.

622
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:01,487
I love your haunt.

623
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,351
It's big and scary.

624
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:05,422
It's okay.

625
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,228
Hey.

626
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:37,056
Hey. You guys
just finish?

627
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,265
We're just heading in.

628
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:39,369
Okay, I'm going to the
bookstore until

629
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:40,888
you guys are done.

630
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,924
You don't like escape rooms?

631
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:45,099
No, I mean, they're just
expensive.

632
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,239
No, Bradford
has a thing with them.

633
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,965
They come to the haunt
for free,

634
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,381
we get to drop in on rooms
that aren't reserved.

635
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,452
Oh, fuck yeah. Let's go.

636
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,488
I went by her place again.

637
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:55,454
Everything's still there.

638
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:56,559
All her clothes.

639
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,077
Well, I don't think
she left town.

640
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,838
She probably just stopped
coming to the haunt.

641
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,598
Okay, but why wouldn't
she tell me?

642
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,082
We don't have
any reservations

643
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,152
for Hidden Temple.

644
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,740
Have you tried that one?
No.

645
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:06,741
You're the
headless guy.

646
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:08,778
Headless no more.

647
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,780
Bradford can suck a dick.

648
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,885
Well, I mean, now you're
all head all the time.

649
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,785
Hey, sounds promising.

650
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:16,820
Take him to The Hidden
Temple, Walt.

651
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,133
Just give me
five minutes.

652
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:22,792
Step this way
to await your fate.

653
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,401
Fuckin'...

654
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,927
So, is this your first
time or...

655
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,446
No.
For what?

656
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,631
All right,
same as yoozh.

657
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:09,735
If something doesn't
move easily,

658
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:10,943
it's not supposed
to move.

659
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,462
So don't break shit.

660
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,429
Don't cheap out, Walt.

661
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,327
Set the mood.

662
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:18,813
Welcome to the temple
of mystery.

663
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:21,885
What untold wonder
lay in wait?

664
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,752
Now, if you'll direct your
attention to the

665
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,686
ancient temple's
functional television.

666
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,865
I've got another group.

667
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,386
Okay, ladies,
it's time to crack

668
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:41,836
some ancient mysteries.

669
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,712
Man, come on.
We got a show going.

670
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,853
Hey, come on.
You gotta get out of here.

671
00:38:59,129 --> 00:38:59,475
Come on.

672
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:03,064
Come on. Let's go.

673
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:03,858
Come on.

674
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,258
We've got a dead guy.

675
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,054
Jack!

676
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,436
Paint me like one of
your French girls.

677
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:32,231
Exactly.
Hey! Hey!

678
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,199
You got it!
Whoa!

679
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:35,373
Very nice.

680
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,398
No, no! NO!

681
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:02,503
You go, I go, you go,

682
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,229
she goes, she goes.

683
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,333
So five. I'm last?

684
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,300
- Yeah.
- Okay.

685
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,543
Do it again.

686
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:09,993
You go, I go, you go,
she goes, she goes.

687
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,305
Okay. Let's just
do it.

688
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,619
Five.

689
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,311
Whoa!
Bingo.

690
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,209
Oh shit.

691
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:22,420
Oh my God.

692
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,491
Get one of it grabbing me!

693
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:25,388
Okay.

694
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:26,941
Get this one.

695
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:29,392
We've got
another body.

696
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:30,945
This one's fresher and

697
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,430
doesn't have a head.

698
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:33,500
Wait, I need
your passcode.

699
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:35,433
1031.

700
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:36,675
We're always in
haunt makeup,

701
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,366
we know everyone's codes.

702
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:39,471
Okay, ready?

703
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,335
One, two, three.

704
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:44,200
No flash. No flash.

705
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:45,512
Well, I don't know
if you're gonna be able--

706
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,478
It'll be fine.

707
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:48,169
Three, two, one.

708
00:40:49,274 --> 00:40:51,621
Door's open.
What'd you do?

709
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:53,520
I pushed on it.
It was already open.

710
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,107
That was an
easy puzzle to solve.

711
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,454
Just watch your step.

712
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,732
There's a lot of fake blood.

713
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,665
Excuse me.

714
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:02,149
This is so cool.

715
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:04,013
This guy's big.

716
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:07,810
Nice!

717
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:09,363
Rocks!

718
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,106
Ready?

719
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,628
You have defeated
the evil spirits

720
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:34,077
and saved a grateful world.

721
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,183
Please allow me to bestow
unto you 10 percent off

722
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,288
any meal in the food court.

723
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:40,705
Except for the pizza place,
they won't play ball.

724
00:41:40,843 --> 00:41:42,534
- That sucks.
- Yeah, they're dicks,

725
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:44,122
you know.
- Yeah whatever.

726
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,503
Yeah, but, hey,
did you all have fun?

727
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:46,573
I did!

728
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:47,953
And you got money
off some food!

729
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,369
Yeah, it's much
more difficult than I thought.

730
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,684
I can't believe
you went full price.

731
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,375
I wanted pizza. I ain't
no coupon's bitch.

732
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,413
Does Bradford have any
deals at the arcade?

733
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,173
We could Skee-ball.

734
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,175
The haunt has an arcade,
so we can play for free there.

735
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,902
Same goes for bowling,
mini golf, and the go carts.

736
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,732
But then you're, like,
back at work.

737
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,665
I mean, we're there
all the time, so...

738
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:11,563
Yeah, we're usually there
first thing on Sundays.

739
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:13,289
But today just felt like the
perfect day to

740
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:14,393
escape from a room.

741
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,257
No arguments here.

742
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:19,088
We might get paid fuck all
for haunting people, but

743
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:21,400
then the stuff we would spend
our money on is free.

744
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,782
Or 10 percent off.

745
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,371
I also work at Fit Perfect
four days a week,

746
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,407
but you're not going to catch
me in there on a day off.

747
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,582
You only just go back
to haunt then?

748
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,584
Have you guys carved
pumpkins yet?

749
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,275
Tonight's the last night
of Pumpkin Fest.

750
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:35,656
What's Pumpkin Fest?

751
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:38,728
Oh, no, but
that would be a perfect post.

752
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:40,799
I have to go back to the
house first.

753
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,767
I want to change.
- Mika.

754
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,045
She good?

755
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,598
You guys go ahead.

756
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:47,979
We'll meet you there.

757
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:50,222
- Okay.
- Okay.

758
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,433
I haven't really
been up in this suburb,

759
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,264
but it feels like it's one
waterslide park away

760
00:42:57,402 --> 00:43:00,301
from becoming a full blown
tourist trap.

761
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,337
They have one.

762
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,132
It's just closed
for the season.

763
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,927
The funny thing is,
is that if you drive

764
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,792
like five miles north
or five miles west, you're

765
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,691
basically surrounded by forest
preserves or cornfields.

766
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,175
That's so weird.

767
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:13,798
And then right in the middle,
they just have this random

768
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:16,145
theme park where nothing is
actually real.

769
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:19,458
It's all fantasy, right?

770
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,046
My Instagram is the
same thing for me.

771
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,428
It's this sexy
goth...

772
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:24,636
...theme park.

773
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,604
Any time anybody
wants to spend

774
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:29,986
a few minutes in that world,
they know where to find me.

775
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,471
Yeah, and what do you
get out of it?

776
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,576
Other than money?

777
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,302
Money is good. Yes.

778
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,994
It's fantasy for me
too, but I get to control it.

779
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,652
It's this dark, chaotic,

780
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,413
kinky world that I get
to completely own and shape.

781
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,831
The haunt is the same thing
for Bradford,

782
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,453
ushering other people
into admire it is

783
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,662
just a bonus.

784
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,112
Fair enough.

785
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:03,813
I'll just put these right
back where I found them.

786
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,125
Yeah, Yeah, you can just
put them there.

787
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:06,367
Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

788
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:08,369
You got quite a
closet in there.

789
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,094
Yeah.

790
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:10,406
I like to have...

791
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:12,132
...some options.

792
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:17,758
You can stay here tonight
if you want.

793
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:19,173
I'm not like...

794
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,140
I'm not, like, homeless.

795
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:21,728
Cool.

796
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:24,282
I mean, everyone from school
just kinda fucked off to L.A.

797
00:44:24,558 --> 00:44:26,042
I knew if I move back home,
I wouldn't

798
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,974
give this acting thing
a real shot.

799
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:28,148
Yeah.

800
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:29,908
- So I'm going to find a place.
- Here?

801
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:30,702
Yeah.

802
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,704
Not L.A., huh?

803
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,881
I mean, why is this so much
easier for everyone but me?

804
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:42,300
I mean, I don't even know
anything about L.A.

805
00:44:42,438 --> 00:44:44,889
Well, did you know
anything about Chicago?

806
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,753
Well, that was school,

807
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:47,926
this is real life.

808
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:49,410
I mean, do you know

809
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:51,102
how many steps are it takes
to becoming a working actor?

810
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:52,379
- A lot.
- Yeah.

811
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:53,794
There are so many.

812
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,623
I mean, I've been listening
to all these podcasts

813
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:57,522
saying that it will take
five to 10 years

814
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,593
to become an overnight
success.

815
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,008
Except for Topher Grace.

816
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:03,770
You better get started, then.

817
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,116
Well, that's easy for
you to say,

818
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,290
you have Insta' income
at the ready.

819
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:12,088
Hey, I'll check out L.A.
spooky season wraps tomorrow.

820
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:13,952
Let's drive out.

821
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,195
Check it out.

822
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,785
But, Celeste,
it's so fucking scary.

823
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:22,064
I mean, what if I can't be
what I always thought
I was meant to be?

824
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,722
No one's
meant to be anything, but

825
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,965
especially if you don't
give it a try.

826
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:29,796
Either way, it's gotta beat
living in your car.

827
00:45:30,003 --> 00:45:32,281
Hey, I'm gonna
find a place.

828
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:34,593
You're laying on it.
If you want it.

829
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,390
At least until we wrap
the haunt.

830
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,598
Thank you.

831
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,290
You're welcome.

832
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:46,640
â™ª IN THE REVERIE â™ª
by Bailiff

833
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:47,434
Thank you.

834
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:48,884
There you go.

835
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,006
What's up, man? You stay
at the party all night?

836
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:10,215
Oh, God, no.

837
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:13,218
Look, have you heard
anything from Rosemary?

838
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:14,323
No. Why?

839
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:15,496
Were we supposed to
have plans?

840
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:17,533
No, she's just
not replying to my texts.

841
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,260
Maybe she's on a
phone break.

842
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,849
Naw, she wasn't home
last night either.

843
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:24,540
Last night?

844
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,438
Are you guys like...

845
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:28,199
Oh, shit, dude.

846
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:30,132
Are you...

847
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,340
Are you fryin' each
other's bacon?

848
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:32,582
Mmm mm.

849
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,825
Are you roasting that
ham bone-in, dude?

850
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:34,999
Danny, stop.

851
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:36,966
What, they're just
pork variations.

852
00:46:37,104 --> 00:46:38,450
Implying that you're porkin'.

853
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,142
Okay, you're being weird.

854
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:43,110
Dude, I can't believe it.
I've been walking around here

855
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:44,284
thinking that
we're the three Musketeers

856
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:45,630
and this whole time

857
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,218
you two have been barbecuing
each other's baby backs.

858
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:49,254
I don't even know what
the fuck that means?

859
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:50,635
You know, just porkin'.

860
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:51,878
Dude, look.

861
00:46:52,016 --> 00:46:53,362
It's haunt season,
anything goes.

862
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,536
Sometimes her and I,
we help each other out.

863
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:58,332
That's not what this is about.
- Help each other out.

864
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,163
Oh, dude, and I thought only
John Cassavetes and the devil

865
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:02,820
got to know Rosemary
like that, bro.

866
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,166
Come on. Don't be a dick.

867
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:05,684
Whatever. Fuck off.
Hey, can you watch the bar?

868
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,169
I know you're not working.

869
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:08,446
For how long?

870
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:09,861
Forever?

871
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,173
It'll just be a second.

872
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,831
Goddamn it, dude.

873
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:18,421
Rosemary, you out here?

874
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:38,717
- Dude...
- Mmm.

875
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,858
It's like she took off in the
middle of doing the laundry.

876
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:43,170
So do your own laundry,
Patriarchy?

877
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,758
This weird for her.

878
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,691
First, Taylor leaves, and
that's not like her;

879
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,280
then Josh; Mika with this
whole stupid phone thing;

880
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:50,557
and Rosie's not here.

881
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,076
I don't know, man.
Something's up.

882
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:54,319
Please, dude, you've gone
days without answering texts.

883
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:56,390
Nice double standard,
Patriarchy.

884
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:57,564
This feels weird.

885
00:47:57,702 --> 00:47:59,842
This whole season
feels fucking weird, man.

886
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,948
Like, yeah, back in the day,
it was like a hobby.

887
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:03,708
So people came
and they went, did whatever.

888
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:04,951
But now, like,

889
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:06,607
I don't know, people
miss a whole week at work

890
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,092
before they miss a single day
at the haunt.

891
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,783
Suddenly everybody disappears?

892
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:11,992
Dude. It's all aesthetic, man.

893
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,684
It's diet darkness draped in
a Jack Skellington backpack.

894
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,410
Come on.

895
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:18,309
Like, Rosie said it last night,
it's starting to

896
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:20,898
feel like college.
Maybe she's ready to grow up.

897
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:22,278
Dude, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

898
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:23,348
We're down the
street from

899
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:25,005
demon fucking Disneyland
over there,

900
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,662
and even our thing
is starting to feel tired.

901
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,250
Dude, none of it's scary.

902
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:29,665
I'm telling you,
none of it's scary.

903
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:30,977
It's supposed to be scary.

904
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:32,840
No, it's supposed
to be fun.

905
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:34,152
Okay. Yeah.

906
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,291
Tell that to an ancient
Celt as a druid pushes

907
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:36,775
him into a burning pyre.

908
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:38,087
I don't know, man.

909
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:39,019
I just like the drama.

910
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:43,921
â™ª DOWN IN THE BASEMENT â™ª
by HoliznaCC0

911
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:16,806
Get those angles.

912
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:18,360
V!

913
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,672
I need you to be
my camera person.

914
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:23,951
- I think I'm done?
- Look.

915
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:25,677
- Classic.
- Yeah.

916
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,335
Listen, I'm sorry. Okay?

917
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:29,888
Cool.

918
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,407
Like, I was just freaked out
about Taylor.

919
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,513
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

920
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:34,548
Okay.

921
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:36,585
But, like, I was worried
something happened to her,

922
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:39,484
like, something bad,
but I guess she's okay.

923
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,866
Okay with Rosemary
instead of me.

924
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:43,592
- Rosemary?
- Yeah.

925
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,559
That's...
I don't know.

926
00:50:45,697 --> 00:50:47,251
It seems like
she'd be a little less

927
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:49,736
surprised being hung up
on the wall, but...

928
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:51,427
I mean, I don't know,
like, Taylor is the type

929
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:53,533
not to want to talk about it,
when it's time to move on,

930
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:56,260
so... yeah.

931
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:03,715
Um, you know what?

932
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,234
Tell the coven
I had to go, yeah?

933
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:06,201
Yeah. Fore suresies.

934
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:07,650
Is everything okay?
- Yup.

935
00:51:09,756 --> 00:51:10,895
I don't know where those
lips have been.

936
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,552
Oh, I'm pretty sure
you can guess.

937
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,072
Yeah, probably.

938
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,106
Rosemary?

939
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,144
It's Mika.

940
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:30,457
Rosemary?

941
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,159
Rosemary?

942
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:52,030
Rosemary? It's Mika.

943
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:56,690
Stop! What the fuck
are you doing?

944
00:52:56,828 --> 00:52:58,244
Are you fucking crazy?

945
00:52:58,485 --> 00:52:59,176
Stop!

946
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,280
Stop!

947
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:01,868
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

948
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:03,525
Get these the fuck
off of me!

949
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:05,734
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

950
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:07,253
Get these off of me!

951
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:09,738
Fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?

952
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:13,017
Stop!
Are you fucking crazy?

953
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:14,121
Stop!

954
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,510
Get the fuck away from me!

955
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,547
Get the fuck away from me!

956
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,584
Get the fuck away from me!

957
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,625
Rosie!

958
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:56,267
Help!

959
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:11,972
Hello?

960
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:28,920
Who's in there?

961
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:43,487
Boo!

962
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,833
Fucking Christ, Danny.

963
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:46,559
What the fuck are you doing
out here, man?

964
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:48,215
Messing with you, man.
Come on, let's get outta here.

965
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:49,251
What do you mean
you're messing with me?

966
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,217
What was with
all the screaming?

967
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:51,426
Dude, I was
fucking with you.

968
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:52,599
Yeah, that wasn't you
screaming, though.

969
00:54:52,737 --> 00:54:54,118
- Dude--
- Who the fuck's out here?

970
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:55,533
Is Rosemary out here
with you, because--

971
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,983
Hey! Nobody's out here, man.

972
00:54:57,121 --> 00:54:58,295
Let's get a drink. Come on.
Just you and me. Let's go.

973
00:54:58,433 --> 00:54:59,675
Just come with me.

974
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:03,921
The fuck's going on, man?

975
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:05,992
Who's out here?

976
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:07,131
Dude, hey...

977
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,788
Look, um...

978
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:12,895
It's not time.

979
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,312
Not time for what?

980
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:20,489
Is that real?

981
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:38,921
Fuck.

982
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:46,412
One, two, three.

983
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:48,759
Oh, no Flash. No flash.

984
00:55:48,897 --> 00:55:51,071
Okay, sorry.
Ready?

985
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:53,350
One, two, three.

986
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:55,317
Okay, got it.

987
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:56,663
Let me see.

988
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,149
â™ª LA NINA BLANCA â™ª
by Vienna Ditto

989
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:04,602
Dude,

990
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,708
I have to do more
pumpkin pin-ups.

991
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:08,951
This thing is killing.

992
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,574
Were you scared when
you posted your first nude?

993
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:11,575
Sure.

994
00:56:12,438 --> 00:56:13,853
Then why'd you do it?

995
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:16,821
This is mine.

996
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:18,754
I'm going to do with it
what I want.

997
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:20,998
And then eventually
I wanted to do it more than

998
00:56:21,136 --> 00:56:24,104
I was scared of it.
- Cool.

999
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,968
Oh. Then somebody immediately

1000
00:56:26,106 --> 00:56:28,661
sent me a dick tribute to my
message requests and, uh...

1001
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,595
Learned to stay away
from there.

1002
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:34,736
I feel like one picture of a
rando dick would have

1003
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:35,944
been enough to scare me off,

1004
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,498
but it doesn't take much.

1005
00:56:38,636 --> 00:56:40,327
I'm scared of everything.

1006
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:41,432
No. Yeah, for sure.

1007
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,400
Says the evil
possessed scarecrow.

1008
00:56:43,538 --> 00:56:45,505
Hey, but you will
never find a gentler,

1009
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,162
kinder evil scarecrow.

1010
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,819
I can work at a
haunted house.

1011
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:50,510
I just can't go through one.

1012
00:56:50,648 --> 00:56:53,099
I tried last year.
You remember?

1013
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,483
Dude, she was out
of there so fast.

1014
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,588
The first time something
jumped out at us.

1015
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:00,865
I turn around...

1016
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:02,073
She gone.

1017
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:03,074
Nearest exit.

1018
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,213
I think I made it, like,

1019
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:05,767
one room.

1020
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:08,873
Totally abandoned me to face
the zombies on my own.

1021
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,357
I couldn't help it.

1022
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:12,705
When it came down to saving
you or saving myself,

1023
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:14,983
it wasn't even a
conscious decision.

1024
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:16,433
My legs decided for me.

1025
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:18,883
Hey, my legs did the
same for me.

1026
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:20,264
They were like:

1027
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:21,955
You think you can hide
these babies from the world?

1028
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:25,131
I had to debunk the supposed
allure of a thigh gap.

1029
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:27,098
Ahh, preach.

1030
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,756
Every body is beautiful.

1031
00:58:00,822 --> 00:58:02,340
You okay?

1032
00:58:05,102 --> 00:58:07,035
Happy Halloween.

1033
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:46,419
Happy Halloween.

1034
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:50,216
Oh, Happy Halloween.

1035
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:51,355
Coffee?

1036
00:58:51,873 --> 00:58:52,874
Sure.

1037
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,434
Your place is really nice.

1038
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,092
Thanks.

1039
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,887
You know, it always makes
me a little sad.

1040
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:07,371
Hmm?

1041
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:09,511
I try to keep the spirit alive
until November 1st, but

1042
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:11,375
it always already feels over.

1043
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:12,410
Well, how do you
think I feel?

1044
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,205
I just met you
bunch of weirdos.

1045
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:15,517
Well,

1046
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:16,691
It's better to have been
scalped a couple nights

1047
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:18,485
than to have never been
scalped at all.

1048
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:20,557
That old chestnut.

1049
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:23,421
You got another
job to go to?

1050
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:28,875
- No. You?
- Job?

1051
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,946
I got a career.

1052
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:32,948
I'm a fixed income analyst.

1053
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:36,055
Um... What?

1054
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:37,504
When I got this place,
I figured I'd be here

1055
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:40,300
all summer, but I mostly
just rent it out.

1056
00:59:40,922 --> 00:59:42,233
I use my vacation time
to come out and

1057
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,303
do this every year.

1058
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:45,754
So this is like
your vacation?

1059
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:47,894
Does it feel like
working to you?

1060
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:49,758
TouchÃ©.

1061
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:50,656
TouchÃ©.

1062
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:55,212
I just want to say
thank you for

1063
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,179
letting me stay here
for a little bit.

1064
00:59:57,317 --> 00:59:58,629
Of course.

1065
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,736
I just want to ask, though,

1066
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:03,496
just curious, why don't
you come hang out

1067
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:05,498
if you let everyone
always stay?

1068
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,396
I hang out.

1069
01:00:08,466 --> 01:00:11,021
When we're all covered
in blood and screaming.

1070
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:12,367
Once we wipe off the blood,

1071
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,403
we're just into
different things.

1072
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:16,647
Yeah.

1073
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:18,615
How's it treating you?

1074
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:21,514
Well, I've wanted to
scream my head off

1075
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,378
in public for years,

1076
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:25,794
so now I actually get people
to line up and watch it.

1077
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:27,934
Like a pressure relief
valve every October.

1078
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:29,971
Exactly.

1079
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,940
To one more night
of unrelenting horror.

- No word from Mika still?
- No.

1082
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:23,403
- She wouldn't just bail.
- Yeah.

1083
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,611
Maybe she made up
with Taylor

1084
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,096
and they're off
whatever'ing?

1085
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:27,373
She'd still text me back.

1086
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:29,409
Yeah, she would.

1087
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:31,204
It's the big night!

1088
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:34,000
Weird news,

1089
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:35,830
but Bradford and Rosemary
can't be here tonight.

1090
01:01:37,245 --> 01:01:38,349
I know, I know.

1091
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:40,213
I wish they could be here too,

1092
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:42,595
but they have given everything
so that we could

1093
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:45,391
all come together
and have a very special night.

1094
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:47,565
Okay? Let's not
let them down.

1095
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,498
I'm only making one
really big change.

1096
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:51,673
And that is to
the final tableau.

1097
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:53,917
Jace.
- Yeah.

1098
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:55,850
I know you're usually
in the mausoleum,

1099
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:58,749
but that's going to be
a whole other thing tonight.

1100
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:00,924
Would you be up for jumping in
with Matilda

1101
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:02,546
in the torture chamber?

1102
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,721
I can scalp a bitch.

1103
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:07,206
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Excuse me?

1104
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:09,967
I'm so sorry. Um...

1105
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,280
I can, with your
blessing and consent,

1106
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:14,523
gently remove a bitch's hair.

1107
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:15,455
Thank you.

1108
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:16,525
- That's better.
- Okay.

1109
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:18,044
People, hey...

1110
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:20,460
I don't want anything
to break the mood,

1111
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:23,256
so make absolutely sure
leave your fucking cell phones

1112
01:02:23,394 --> 01:02:24,741
in your fucking lockers.

1113
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:26,604
All right?

1114
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,331
I know we usually want
to have fun, right?

1115
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:30,816
But tonight,

1116
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,990
nobody walks away unchanged.

1117
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,096
Nobody.

1118
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,718
Tonight,

1119
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:41,585
we undo the sacrilege
of generations and embrace

1120
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:44,484
the terrifying traditions
of what All Hallow's Eve

1121
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:47,625
was always meant to be.

1122
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:49,938

All right, What do
we got here?

1126
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:17,310
Oh, it's all just

1127
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:19,105
Yeah, it's, uh...

1128
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:22,729
Wait, so we're doing something
different tonight, right?

1129
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:26,492
Yeah. Why?

1130
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:29,288
It's Halloween!

1131
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,294
A time for pretend, right?

1132
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:36,571
Yeah?

1133
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:39,677
How many of you have used
a Halloween costume

1134
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,128
as an excuse to show the world

1135
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,855
something real that you've
kept hidden away?

1136
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:47,927
Yeah? One, two... yeah?

1137
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:50,654
I am.

1138
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:53,208
The entire rest of my
life is the costume!

1139
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:55,555
Yeah!

1140
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:56,902
Tonight,

1141
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:59,559
I finally get to be

1142
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:01,907
what I was always meant to be.

1143
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,530
When we walk
through that door,

1144
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,050
I am going to kill
as many of you

1145
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:08,534
as I possibly can.

1146
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,745
Yeah! Literally kill you!

1147
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:15,817
You all thought tonight
was a night of make believe.

1148
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:18,820
But tonight is a night
of sacrifice.

1149
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,375
Observe.

1150
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,901
Who's first?

1151
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:34,284
Okay. Okay.

1152
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,391
Only those marked
with the blood of the knife

1153
01:04:38,529 --> 01:04:40,221
will die tonight.

1154
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:42,913
Before the pageantry,
before the pyres

1155
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:46,227
were reserved for animals,
there was one order

1156
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:49,471
that understood
the power of human sacrifice.

1157
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:52,267
They marked their offerings
in their own blood,

1158
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:54,200
then struck them down
during the final harvest

1159
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:56,133
of the season.

1160
01:04:56,754 --> 01:05:00,344
They harvested the imposters
and the hypocrites,

1161
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:02,001
those who pretended to be
something they

1162
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,589
could never hope to be.

1163
01:05:03,727 --> 01:05:07,075
And in doing so, proved
their own righteousness.

1164
01:05:25,611 --> 01:05:27,578
Whoa.

1165
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:28,994
That's awesome.

1166
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:44,181
Observe this sacrifice
as a warning.

If you follow me,
you also follow him

1168
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:49,290

Mark me.

1251
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:07,219
With the blood.

1252
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:09,842
What?

1253
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,051
Make me a sacrifice.

1254
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:14,847
Mark me!

1255
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:15,779
Danny, stop.

1256
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:17,263
Danny, stop!

1257
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:41,218
V, we've gotta go.

1258
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:42,565
V, we've got to go!

1259
01:12:42,703 --> 01:12:43,669
Don't look, it's okay.

1260
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:44,774
Don't look, it's okay!

1261
01:12:46,258 --> 01:12:47,949
Guys! What the fuck
is going on?

1262
01:12:48,087 --> 01:12:49,434
Danny, he...
he killed a guy in there,

1263
01:12:49,572 --> 01:12:51,919
and he tried to kill V.
- What? Get me out!

1264
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:54,300
Hurry! Hurry!

1265
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,136
God! Help!

1266
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:03,137
What are you doing?
Get me out!

1267
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:06,071
Help! Help!
Oh fuck! Help me!

1268
01:13:32,684 --> 01:13:33,857
What's going on? V!

1269
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:42,107
Yo.

1270
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,385
My phone's in the
changing room!

1271
01:13:45,144 --> 01:13:46,422
Call the police!
Call that police!

1272
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,429
Throw the dagger.
What?

1273
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:29,844
Throw the
dagger far.

1274
01:14:29,982 --> 01:14:30,949
There's something
about it. Throw it far,

1275
01:14:31,087 --> 01:14:32,813
he'll go for it, and
we can escape.

1276
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:35,298
Oh my God!

1277
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:36,782
No! Danny! Please!

1278
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:40,303
No! Danny!

1279
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:00,219
Help! Someone!

1280
01:15:01,324 --> 01:15:02,256
Help!

1281
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:06,156
Help me!

1282
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,226
Someone!

1283
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:09,574
You can do it.

1284
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,030
Please! Please!

1285
01:15:18,168 --> 01:15:19,307
Danny! Stop!

1286
01:15:19,722 --> 01:15:20,861
No, no, no!

1287
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:24,485
No, Danny!

1288
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:25,659
Get off of me!

1289
01:15:31,354 --> 01:15:34,012
Please!
Somebody do something!

1290
01:15:40,743 --> 01:15:43,366
This is real! This is real!

1291
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,112
Holy shit.

1292
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,567
Are you okay?

1293
01:16:40,112 --> 01:16:42,494
The fuck happened
in there, you guys?

1294
01:16:45,566 --> 01:16:47,430
You wanna talk about it?

1295
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:52,159
That's it.

1296
01:16:52,297 --> 01:16:53,436
I'm going to L.A.

1297
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:54,748
Right now?

1298
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:58,614
- Yeah.
- You're not scared anymore?

1299
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,307
Of going to L.A.?

1300
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:03,757
No.

1301
