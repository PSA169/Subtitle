1
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,208
Mbah Sarap,

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,333
you were caught and punished

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,458
for using black magic on humans.

4
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,125
There were too many victims
of your witchcraft.

5
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,958
I, as the Royal Chief, have decided,

6
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,041
to sentence you to death

7
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,458
for the sins that you have committed.

8
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:20,750
I was only trying to help people.

9
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,875
Liar! Don't trust her!

10
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,666
Please don't punish me!

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Evil witch!

12
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,083
Soon you'll be dead.

13
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:39,625
Seek forgiveness from your victims
and repent to God!

14
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,416
When misery comes,

15
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,125
all of you will be looking for me.

16
00:01:54,875 --> 00:02:00,166
When misery and hunger filled your lives…

17
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,625
I fed you and gave you wealth.

18
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:18,291
You were barren and worthless.

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,166
I gave you offspring.

20
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:35,083
I gave you all of those.

21
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,875
I gave you all of those!

22
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,833
Not from your God.

23
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,166
Be ready to die.

24
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,750
It's time for you to die.

25
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,708
Please let me go!

26
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,791
Release me from this punishment.

27
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,458
Or I will…

28
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,916
take all of your lives too.

29
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,916
Like wild animals!

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,125
Off with her head!

31
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,458
Can I get rice and egg?

32
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,583
Anything else? We have meat and fish.

33
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,583
Just an egg.

34
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,208
Okay, wait a minute.

35
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,666
-Here you go.
-How much?

36
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,958
With an egg, that'll be 8,500 rupiah.

37
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,250
Please take out the egg.
I'm short of money.

38
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,041
That's okay. You can have it.

39
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

40
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,291
Going somewhere, gorgeous?

41
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,500
You better pay up your father's debt.

42
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,500
I'll pay. But we have a deal.
I still have time.

43
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,208
My boss changed his mind.

44
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:42,458
You must pay it tonight
or you and your sister will be hookers.

45
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,333
Don't mess with us!

46
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,750
What are you looking at?

47
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,291
Three days.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,916
Give me three days.
I'll pay off my father's debt.

49
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,791
You think I'm scared?

50
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,458
You cut him! He's bleeding!

51
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,375
You're dead, you hear me!

52
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,458
Enough.

53
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,125
I give you three days, or you're dead.

54
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,708
Let's go. Let's find a doctor.

55
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,541
Stop playing! Listen to me.

56
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,541
What is it?

57
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,916
You got my sister pregnant.
You told her to have an abortion.

58
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,958
This money isn't enough for that abortion!

59
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,333
You can take this!

60
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,041
-Bro.
-What do you want?

61
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,750
Where's Bagas?

62
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,666
Over there.

63
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,708
He refused to go to bed early.
He wanted to wait for you.

64
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,375
What happened to you, Lin?

65
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,416
I'm fine.

66
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,833
I'll take Bagas home now.

67
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,041
Lin, how is that fine?

68
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,291
-Bagas.
-You're still bleeding.

69
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,458
Let's go home.

70
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,291
I'm fine.

71
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,458
-Thanks, anyway.
-You're welcome.

72
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,500
You asshole! I'll kill you!

73
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,750
You'll die!

74
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,583
-Cowards!
-Stay away from Fitrah!

75
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,375
We don't need your money!

76
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,458
Stop it!

77
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,833
You're dirt-poor!

78
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,458
Alin.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,541
Bagas, why are you awake?

80
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,541
Are you thirsty?

81
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,791
Going back to sleep?

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,625
I'm hungry.

83
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,250
You haven't eaten?

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,541
-I only have this rice.
-Yes, I want it!

85
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,250
Don't you want to use a plate?

86
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,166
You want some?

87
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,500
You can have it all.

88
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,666
Come here.

89
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,166
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

90
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,166
What happened to your hands?

91
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,583
-They're fine. Put this on.
-Okay.

92
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,375
-Are you ready?
-Ready.

93
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,333
-Where are we off to?
-To the moon.

94
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,208
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

95
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,250
-Let's fly.
-Pull up and take off.

96
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,250
We're so high in the sky. Keep flying!

97
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,125
Get ready!

98
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,541
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah!

99
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,750
There are the moon and the stars.

100
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
So cool!

101
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,291
Bagas?

102
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,958
Yes?

103
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,541
I have to go to work, okay?

104
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,833
Will you be long?

105
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,416
Please pray for me, okay?

106
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,583
This is for you.

107
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,333
So, when you're home later,
you'll bring so much money.

108
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,041
Then we can fly together.

109
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,875
Cheer up, big sis!

110
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,291
Okay! Let's fly one more time.

111
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,416
One, two, we're flying!

112
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,083
Look at those beautiful moons and stars.

113
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,291
Yeah.

114
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,958
Lots of moons?

115
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,541
You're right! We only have lots of stars!

116
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,333
Alin…

117
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,916
Alin!

118
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,375
Come with me, Alin.

119
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,875
I died because of you!

120
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,375
Your mother died too.

121
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,291
I will keep torturing you!

122
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,416
Die!

123
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,916
You got somebody's daughter pregnant.
You gamble! You're in debt.

124
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,416
Causing trouble everywhere.

125
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,666
Time to work.

126
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,625
No more causing trouble. Focus!

127
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,375
You're the one who brought trouble!

128
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,166
You asked Alin to work with us!

129
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,333
-Lin, it's better if you think it over.
-I'm still going.

130
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,125
It's easy for you to say!

131
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,958
No. I'm not okay with it.

132
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,958
Who do you think you are?
Telling people around.

133
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,000
-I thought we had a deal.
-A deal?

134
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,833
You set us up!

135
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,208
You left your brother to Gani.

136
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,791
Then you screw him over.

137
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,291
-Let it go, Fit.
-What?

138
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,125
Where is the recording?

139
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,708
Where is it?

140
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,250
Give it to me!

141
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,791
-Fit!
-Answer me, now!

142
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,666
You said there are two choices. What? Two!

143
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,416
One.

144
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,625
I'm robing with you tonight,

145
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
-Two?
-Fit.

146
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,083
I will report you to the police.

147
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,416
I'll make it three and you'll die tonight.

148
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,083
You're crazy!

149
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,166
-She's somebody's daughter!
-So?

150
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,458
You're out of your mind! Bastard!

151
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,166
Lin, you can't go.

152
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,916
Apologizing won't be enough
for your issue with Fitrah.

153
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,291
Your friend won't dare to mess with me.

154
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,291
Who said that?

155
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,833
I know for sure.

156
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,416
We're "visiting" someone's home.

157
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,041
We're robbing them.
Surely that comes with risks.

158
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,208
Our objectives are justified.

159
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,916
We have no choice.

160
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,083
Zia's heart surgery can't wait.

161
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,583
You got a girl pregnant
and want an abortion.

162
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,166
Now you send her money monthly.

163
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,958
That's my business!

164
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,333
Are you ready to give up nursing school?

165
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,041
I know you're not bad guys.

166
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,791
That's why I leave Bagas with you, Gan.

167
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,625
I still have to go with you.

168
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,333
Deal with your girlfriend.

169
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,416
Lin, why don't I just lend you the money?

170
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,583
I have enough savings to help you.

171
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,833
My late mother told me this.

172
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,625
"Son, you must be a decisive, strong,
and tough person to handle the problems."

173
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,916
"Whatever happens,
rain or shine, don't give up."

174
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,750
You have that inside of you.

175
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,291
Let's go.

176
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,875
The runners are
approaching the final 100 meters.

177
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,875
Runner Zia Deliana from East Java
is leading followed by her rivals.

178
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,666
Will she be able to bring a gold medal
to her contingent?

179
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,916
Zia Deliana stumbles
and is trying hard to get back up

180
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,916
but she can't finish the race.

181
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,875
And South Sumatra league passed her
and got first place.

182
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,541
Followed by two runners from Jakarta,
Magie and Hana,

183
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,125
in second and third place.

184
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,208
Now we'll see how Zia Deliana is doing…

185
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,166
Are we going?

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,833
Just wait.

187
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,166
So, she really is coming with us?

188
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,625
Yes, she is.

189
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,791
Lin, this is Zia.

190
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,333
She's my friend from Malang.

191
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,583
Zi?

192
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,041
Alin.

193
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,416
Alin.

194
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,125
She's pretty, Gan.

195
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,041
Prettier than your last crush.
What was her name?

196
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,250
That girl from Depok,
the mini mart cashier?

197
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,250
The one who looked like Ancol's monkey?

198
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,958
Ancol's monkey!

199
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,041
Crap!

200
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,458
Your mouth really has no filter.

201
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,041
Enough! Stop it.

202
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,833
What are you doing?

203
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,458
Are we going to "visit"?

204
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,791
What a sulky boy.

205
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,833
Yeah, a sulky little boy.

206
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,166
Listen to me carefully, Alin.

207
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:04,916
Fitrah

208
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,750
and Gani…

209
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,958
are like family to me.

210
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:16,541
So, if anything happens to my family
because of you…

211
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,666
Surely that comes with risks.

212
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,791
I needed this to ensure
that I can come with you.

213
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,625
Our objectives are justified.

214
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,416
Now, I don't need it.

215
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,208
I have no problem with any of you.

216
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,875
All I need is money.

217
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,541
Okay, she's my responsibility.

218
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,333
Is that the house? That's cool!

219
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,833
Guys.

220
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,375
I think somebody's in the house.

221
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,000
There is a car parked outside.

222
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,000
But it's supposed to be empty.

223
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:47,791
Well, Doddy was told by his insider
who worked there as maid for three months.

224
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,833
They said the family is out every Friday.
Doddy's insider took a day off too.

225
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,375
Hello, love!

226
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,458
-Morning!
-Ready to go in?

227
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,958
-Well, we are--
-Doddy, we arrived at the house,

228
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,333
but there is a car parked there.

229
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,250
It was confirmed that the house is empty.

230
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,416
Maybe they went on a trip without the car.

231
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,958
That's possible, right?

232
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,125
The point is they're gone…

233
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,708
-Doddy?
-Doddy.

234
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,875
Probably the signal.

235
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,208
Fit? What now?

236
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
We need to hold off on this.

237
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,750
-Then what do I do about Citra?
-That's your risk.

238
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,916
You know that.

239
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You said Zia needs urgent surgery.

240
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,916
Fit, don't make her as an excuse.

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,416
The doctor said so!

242
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,708
-Not me!
-Blaming me?

243
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,625
Stop it!

244
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,500
-Zia!
-Zi!

245
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,875
It's fine.

246
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,708
You okay, Zi?

247
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,916
You said he's like a brother
from a different mother.

248
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,958
What family, you fool?

249
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,166
Come here.

250
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,833
If I ever see you both in a stupid fight,

251
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm warning you!

252
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,916
Come on, chill it out.

253
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,458
-We're cool.
-Come on.

254
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,541
Shake hands.

255
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,458
Okay, sorry.

256
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,500
Be sincere.

257
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,583
-I'm sorry.
-Me too.

258
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,166
You guys are like kids.

259
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,000
-He goes nuts sometimes.
-Brothers should be loyal.

260
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,833
We wait until dark,

261
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,833
-then we decide if we'll be visiting.
-Zi!

262
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,875
Shit!

263
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,125
What's wrong with you?

264
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,291
Stop it.

265
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,791
Alin, what's wrong?

266
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:22,791
Sorry!

267
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,833
It's time.

268
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,500
We don't have much time.

269
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,208
This is yours.

270
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,583
Gani, this is your radio and flashlight.

271
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,125
What does Alin get?

272
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:49,375
She gets no radio and no flashlight,
so she has to be close to you.

273
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:54,791
Let's go!

274
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,000
Gan?

275
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,375
You two take the first floor.

276
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,416
I'll go upstairs.

277
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,041
Be back here in 30 minutes.

278
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,458
Alin, remember.

279
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:05,333
Take only the valuables
with large quantities.

280
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,041
Stuff they have lots of.

281
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,041
Take only what you need
so they don't realize it.

282
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:12,833
Don't be greedy.

283
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,166
Alin!

284
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,250
Bagas!

285
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,500
Lin?

286
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,833
Alin.

287
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,083
Alin!

288
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,291
What are you doing?

289
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,166
I saw Bagas here.

290
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,541
-That's impossible. Come on.
-I saw him right here.

291
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,208
It smells awful here, Lin.

292
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,708
Lin!

293
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,041
Lin.

294
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,375
Why are there bodies?

295
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:26,916
This is not right.

296
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,666
Help.

297
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,666
Please help me.

298
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,416
Zia!

299
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:52,500
Zia Deliana stumbles
and is trying hard to get back up…

300
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,791
Zia!

301
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,625
Yes, sorry!

302
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,583
Zi, get the car ready.

303
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,666
What's wrong?

304
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,291
Just get the car ready!

305
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:10,875
Gan.

306
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,500
We must help her, Lin.

307
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,958
But we don't know her.

308
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,958
We don't need to know, she needs us!

309
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,791
How did this happen to you?

310
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,958
Who are you?

311
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
They…

312
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,458
They wanted to sacrifice me.

313
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,250
They who?

314
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,666
Okay, wait.

315
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,041
Gan?

316
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,583
Don't leave me here.

317
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,958
Of course. Wait.

318
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,750
Slow down.

319
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,375
Come on, Lin!

320
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,666
Fitrah!

321
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,666
-Who's that?
-Don't ask.

322
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,625
-Where are you taking her?
-We need to get out.

323
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,333
What is that?

324
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,208
Lin?

325
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:14,875
What's wrong?

326
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,500
Gan?

327
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,375
I'm already at the gate.

328
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,791
Answer her.

329
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,958
Zi, we'll be out shortly.

330
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,250
Why are you answering? Where's Gani?

331
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,708
Fit, what's going on?

332
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,791
Hello? Gani? Fitrah!

333
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,708
What's going on?

334
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:51,375
Gani?

335
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,625
Shit!

336
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:02,958
Fit!

337
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,958
What the hell is going on?

338
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,916
You want us to all die here?

339
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,166
He's losing his mind.

340
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,833
-Fit, it's useless.
-Shut up.

341
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,250
Fit, don't do it!

342
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:37,916
You're crazy, Fit.

343
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,291
This is because of you.

344
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,708
-Come on, Fit.
-What do you mean "come on"?

345
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,000
We're going to die here.

346
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,625
We've "visited" many houses.

347
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,416
Why is this happening?

348
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,583
Pointing fingers
will not solve the problem.

349
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,750
Listen to me while I'm talking.
What is that?

350
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,500
-What are you doing?
-Give it to me.

351
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,083
Fit, come on. Stop it!

352
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,083
See? I was right.

353
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,708
Something is wrong with her!

354
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,916
I told you about the rules.

355
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,541
Why did you take all of this?

356
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,333
Looking for trouble?

357
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,708
-You're a thief!
-I'm not a thief!

358
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm here because I have to be.

359
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,791
I need the money.

360
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,916
I hope this is the first and last time
I'm doing this.

361
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,250
I also don't want to live by stealing.

362
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,375
Enough.

363
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,333
We'll talk about it at home.

364
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,083
Now, we must find a way out.

365
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,416
Please don't go.

366
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,041
Fit, you and Alin
go find any way to get out.

367
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,958
Find out everything about this house.

368
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,500
Me? With Alin?

369
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,583
You're nuts.

370
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,291
Do you want to get out of here?

371
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,791
There's got to be a way.

372
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,875
But we need to find it.

373
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,791
Come on.

374
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:02,958
Gani is right.

375
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,208
Take this.

376
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:19,875
What's this?

377
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,291
To protect yourself.

378
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,041
Fit?

379
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,333
Thanks.

380
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:36,625
Okay.

381
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,625
A family tree.

382
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,916
A family tree.

383
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,541
Sukma Paratrika.

384
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,625
Friday Kliwon.

385
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,375
You can read this?

386
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,750
I went to school in Java.

387
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,666
Look at this!

388
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,000
This woman and Sukma

389
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,041
have the same Weton.

390
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,875
Friday Kliwon.

391
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,541
Sitarasmi Paratrika.

392
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,833
So what if it's the same weton?

393
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,625
All humans…

394
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,125
will die!

395
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:02,750
Zi?

396
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,375
Zi?

397
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:05,916
Zia?

398
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,208
Fitrah!

399
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,375
Alin!

400
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,541
Alin!

401
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:29,916
Bagas!

402
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,500
-Bagas!
-Alin!

403
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:46,666
You!

404
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:56,000
Who are you? Tell me!

405
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,666
What are you talking about?

406
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,041
Tell me who you are?

407
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,666
What did you do to my friends?

408
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,958
Answer me!

409
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:08,833
I've killed all of your friends!

410
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,625
What's really going on?

411
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:13,833
I am your friend.

412
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,708
-No, you're not.
-Now

413
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,500
it's time for you to die.

414
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,166
Gan!

415
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,958
Fitrah! Alin!

416
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,375
Give me back the knife.

417
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,291
I'll kill you!

418
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,708
Gan! Snap out of it!

419
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,375
Just give me the knife!

420
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,916
You've killed

421
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,791
all of my friends, my family!

422
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,458
Bastard!

423
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,708
I am your friend!

424
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,833
Your family, Zia!

425
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:45,000
You will never leave this house.

426
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,291
Open it!

427
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,041
Alin, where are you?

428
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,666
-Fit, where are you?
-In the yard, Zi.

429
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,375
Where are you?

430
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,750
I'm in the yard.

431
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,625
I'm here in the yard.

432
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,041
I'm right here.

433
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,833
You're not here, Fit.

434
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,666
Fitrah!

435
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,458
I'm right here.

436
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,125
I can't see you.

437
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:07,875
Who are you?

438
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,625
I'm Fitrah!

439
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,208
-Where is Fitrah?
-I am Fitrah.

440
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,250
Come with me.

441
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:02,041
Don't run, Zi!

442
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:09,416
Come with me!

443
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:17,458
We'll go to hell.

444
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,458
Forgive me…

445
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:42,541
I can't…

446
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:50,041
I can't take care of all of you.

447
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,750
My brothers…

448
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,458
Bagas?

449
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:08,708
Bagas?

450
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,125
Bagas?

451
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:12,291
Bagas?

452
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:17,250
What are you doing here?

453
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:35,208
DEADLY ACCIDENT IN TEBET

454
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,041
Alin!

455
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,791
Where are you going, Alin?

456
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,291
Don't run away!

457
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:33,041
I just saved all of you

458
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:37,000
from the effects of Median black magic.

459
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:40,041
This black magic
can drive the victims mad.

460
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,166
So, just calm down.

461
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,041
Try not to move.

462
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:49,166
Don't walk around. You might fall, stupid.

463
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,125
-Black magic.
-Slow down!

464
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,166
Median black magic.

465
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,666
-Don't mess with me, sir.
-That black magic…

466
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,041
uses worms as a medium
to induce hallucinations in the victim.

467
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,291
-Understand?
-Alin?

468
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,125
Now…

469
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,583
You need to explain to me

470
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,916
why did you let go that woman go?

471
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,333
Hey, you?

472
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,833
-Who are you?
-I'm nobody.

473
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,666
You are Mbah Sarap's grandson.

474
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,750
-I don't know who Mbah Sarap is.
-Then who?

475
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,750
Learning black magic?

476
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:44,375
I swear, I really don't know
anything about that stuff.

477
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:46,833
Then what are you doing here?

478
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,458
-We're just…
-Just what?

479
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,833
We just wanted to take money.

480
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,041
Like worshiping devil for money?

481
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:56,875
We're thieves.

482
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,375
Imbeciles!

483
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,000
Do you know…

484
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:13,458
the woman that you let go
is very dangerous.

485
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:19,625
Her power is more than
what you've already experienced.

486
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,083
Do you understand?

487
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,750
How would I know about that?

488
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,375
Something is different with you. Come on.

489
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,541
Well, stupid boy!

490
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:45,708
-Come on.
-Hey!

491
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,416
You're asking for trouble!

492
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,875
Please let him go.

493
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:51,041
Gan, are you okay?

494
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,500
Gan!

495
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,666
Gan, stop it!

496
00:54:58,083 --> 00:54:59,375
Let me go, Lin!

497
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,458
Sir, please stop it!

498
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,041
We don't know who you are.

499
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,750
You could be trying to harm us!

500
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,166
If you don't know me, stop your nonsense!

501
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,833
Then tell us who you are!

502
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,500
All right, I'll tell you.

503
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:14,791
I am…

504
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,833
Urip Mahesworo.

505
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:25,166
A noble descendant
of the kingdom in the past.

506
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,375
Twenty years ago,

507
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,250
I was given the task to hunt down

508
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:39,083
those evildoers who practiced black magic.

509
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,541
Twenty-two hours ago,

510
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,333
I came to this house,

511
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:53,958
to end the Prewangan Heritage
of Mbah Sarap.

512
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:00,458
You know, we've experienced
lots of weird things here.

513
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,791
So, it makes sense we don't trust you.

514
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:07,291
Okay.

515
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,166
What are you doing to her?

516
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:27,333
I brought you here
to see how it all started.

517
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,833
No need to talk.

518
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:39,958
Now you're on Java Island in the past.

519
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:41,916
That one was…

520
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,666
the most powerful shaman at that time.

521
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,416
Her name is Mbah Sarap.

522
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,000
Sitarasmi Paratrika.

523
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:12,000
She gets the power from God

524
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:17,000
to create a supernatural entity
called "Khodam."

525
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:21,250
We called them Prewangan.

526
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,958
Mbah Sarap's Prewangan is called Wrejit.

527
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:30,958
Nobody can kill me.

528
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:36,541
Me and Wrejit will live forever.

529
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:42,083
A hundred years of her curse awaits,

530
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:47,458
until the next generation
who is born on the same day as hers

531
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,916
with the name Sukma.

532
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:54,375
Sukma Paratrika. Friday Kliwon.

533
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:57,583
This woman shares the same Weton as Sukma.

534
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,041
The woman you helped.

535
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,541
Come on, Lin!

536
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,833
Smart?

537
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,791
And that curse…

538
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:21,875
can only be broken
by the Keris Sirno Peteng.

539
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:27,875
I may die today.

540
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,625
But Wrejit will find

541
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:38,583
the chosen one from my descendants.

542
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:42,541
They will avenge my death.

543
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:49,708
All humans will die!

544
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,416
That's why

545
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,250
I came to this house,

546
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:19,500
to end the Wrejit's inheritance ritual
from passing to Sukma.

547
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,291
Stop all of this!

548
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,166
Who are you?

549
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,583
Urip Mahesworo.

550
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,750
So, you're the one to
hunt down and kill us.

551
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,000
Mom?

552
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:36,041
Before I find Sirno Peteng,
I must fight them.

553
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:40,375
The choices are to kill or be killed.

554
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,458
Thankfully, God answered my prayers.

555
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:50,291
I've weakened Sukma temporarily.

556
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,541
Until you came and ruined everything.

557
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:09,125
We absolutely…

558
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:13,458
had no intention of ruining your plans.

559
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:19,125
Me, Alin, and…

560
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,083
Where's Fitrah, Lin?

561
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,541
Sir, Fitrah is my friend.

562
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,750
Please help us find him.

563
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:37,750
Sir?

564
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,625
We have to find Keris Sirno Peteng.

565
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:47,166
The kris was lost 200 years ago.

566
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:53,458
However, I sense
a strong Batulangit energy here.

567
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:59,375
Mbah Sarap's children built this house,

568
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:04,833
to easily locate Sirno Peteng
and then cast it into the South Sea.

569
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:10,375
-So, the Keris?
-I think it can been found.

570
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:16,333
Because I sense
the energy is very strong there.

571
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:28,833
I feel coldness
coming from your friend's body,

572
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,208
and he's on the brink of death.

573
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:37,250
Say whatever you need
to say to him before…

574
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,708
-Urip!
-…it's too late.

575
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:39,708
There is a way.

576
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,375
We can go down there.

577
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:50,541
Look, there are stairs. We go down there.

578
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,083
Yes.

579
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:57,958
We have to find Sirno Peteng quickly
to stop Sukma.

580
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:02,125
So we can help your friend.

581
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,375
Lin, what's wrong?

582
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,250
I don't know either.

583
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:15,250
-Wait here, let me and Urip go.
-No, I'm coming.

584
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,541
Okay.

585
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:37,416
Be careful.

586
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:51,916
Lin?

587
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,000
Are you okay?

588
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,250
I'm fine.

589
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,416
Okay.

590
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,750
I think we need something to go in there.

591
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,125
I've been here before.

592
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,791
No way, Lin.

593
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,916
I've dreamed about this place.

594
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:29,833
Who are you exactly?

595
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,500
I am Gani.

596
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:42,916
Gani.

597
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:16,791
Impossible for Alin
to dream about this place.

598
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,541
What is this place?

599
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,291
Where are we?

600
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,583
Where's Alin?

601
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:37,541
Stop… Stop for a while…

602
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,041
Gravitate…

603
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,333
Kidung Semar.

604
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,791
Gravitate…

605
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,375
The spell to ward off bad luck.

606
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,125
When it gravitates…

607
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,916
The spell against evil.

608
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,041
When it gravitates…

609
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,541
The spell of knights,

610
01:07:55,875 --> 01:08:00,833
against the wrathful, to uphold the truth.

611
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,416
Alin?

612
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,333
What's wrong?

613
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:11,708
With evil in the mind

614
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:18,125
And evil in the feet

615
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:24,416
Evil in the feathers

616
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:31,833
Lies within the shoulders

617
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:39,000
Are anguish fueled

618
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:43,541
By rage and greed

619
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:51,416
Unseen by the naked eyes

620
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:58,291
Come back…

621
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:18,333
Come back…

622
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:26,916
To the beginning

623
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,625
Sirno Peteng.

624
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:57,916
A straight kris
that signifies the heart's integrity,

625
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,125
courage,

626
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,333
and strength.

627
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:05,750
Lies within is…

628
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,708
Prewangan Garuda.

629
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:15,958
I ask your permission.

630
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:17,583
Don't…

631
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,333
Don't open it!

632
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,958
Where is that kris?

633
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:48,666
Tell me!

634
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:54,250
Or I will kill all of you!

635
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:15,333
Hey, Jebuk Arum,
the one called Menyan Kreges,

636
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:19,208
following the way Menyan smoke blows
up in the dark clouds,

637
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,458
fly high to the seventh sky,

638
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,750
buried deep to the earth's seventh layer,

639
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:27,041
enter the souls of the mystical ancestors!

640
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:27,958
Run!

641
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:39,791
In the name of the Almighty God,
ruler of the world,

642
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:44,375
the commander of all beings in the world,

643
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:48,666
free us from evil.

644
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,333
Let all the evildoers

645
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,375
return to the condemned hell.

646
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:02,041
May they all burst into bits.

647
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:05,708
By the power of the Almighty God.

648
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,583
Alin!

649
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:24,791
Zia.

650
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,708
Your life and death are in my hands.

651
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:08,833
Oh, Bethari Durgo,
ruler of Setragondomayit,

652
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:12,833
I sent unto you my spells,
my magical spells,

653
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,583
to possess the corpses.

654
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:19,416
Delivered by the haunting
demons and djinns

655
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:22,708
carrying with them the chant of my spells.

656
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:29,166
Powerful spells that touch everything.

657
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,708
Oh, wind with mighty power.

658
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,708
Bring to life the wind,

659
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:37,625
bring to life the words I spoke.

660
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,083
Life being a living word.

661
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,208
Oh, you, named with powers.

662
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:45,291
Come to life. Come to life.

663
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,333
Be alive!

664
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,416
Let's go!

665
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:10,458
Come on!

666
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,833
Lin.

667
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,916
Go ahead and go home first, Lin.

668
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,375
No. Let's go together, Gan.

669
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:46,458
-Fitrah. I must find him.
-You're going to die, Gan.

670
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:59,416
Urip said that you…

671
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:20,208
There's a drawer in my room.

672
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:24,166
I have some savings,
take it for you and Bagas.

673
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,875
-No, Gani.
-Please, take it.

674
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,291
Gan.

675
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,208
Lin. Our lives are in God's hands.

676
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:33,750
Not in Urip's hands.

677
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,333
-Gan.
-Go home now.

678
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,250
-Gani!
-Go home!

679
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:38,625
-No.
-Bagas is waiting.

680
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,458
Gani! Gani!

681
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,125
Gani!

682
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:08,416
Don't worry, Zi.

683
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,833
I won't leave you alone here.

684
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:14,958
Okay? Come on.

685
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,791
Family is loyal.

686
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:24,875
Let's find Fitrah now, Zi.

687
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,125
Gani!

688
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:32,625
Gani!

689
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,375
Gani!

690
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,541
Gani!

691
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,208
Gani!

692
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,791
We were destined

693
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,500
to share life and death.

694
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,583
Hey, Jebuk Arum,

695
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,458
the one called Menyan Kreges,

696
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:32,583
following the way Menyan smoke blows
up in the dark clouds,

697
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,291
fly high to the seventh sky,

698
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:38,208
buried deep to the earth's seventh layer.

699
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,291
Enter the souls of the mystical ancestors.

700
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,916
Enter… enter… enter.

701
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,166
Enter like the kris into its sheath.

702
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:56,208
Enter the souls into the flesh.

703
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:19,750
Whatever happens, come rain, come shine,
you don't give up.

704
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,000
It's time for you to die.

705
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:47,250
No. You'll die!

706
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,208
It's all right, Lin.

707
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,750
It's all right.

708
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,250
Such a weak mortal!

709
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:59,750
Can only cry for those tormented souls.

710
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:41,916
You all think death is the end…

711
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,875
of everything.

712
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:50,250
But death is my resurrection.

713
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:53,875
Watch me.

714
01:24:54,750 --> 01:25:01,750
I'll show you the curse of Mbah Sarap!

715
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,833
Evil kid!

716
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:17,250
You killed your mother and father.

717
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:22,708
Maybe your brother is dead.
You left him alone, Alin!

718
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:25,791
Come join me in hell, Alin!

719
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:07,583
How dare you disobey me?

720
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:13,708
You're not my father.

721
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:48,250
I warned you.

722
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,916
All descendants of Mbah Sarap will be--

723
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,500
Shut up!

724
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:45,166
Gani?

725
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:47,916
Bagas.

726
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:50,708
Where is Gani?

727
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:54,208
Come on.

728
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:05,875
Hey!

729
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,750
Where are you going, gorgeous?

730
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:21,041
-Bagas, wait here.
-Okay.

731
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:38,125
Okay.

732
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,333
Hey.

733
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,458
Your father's debt is settled,

734
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,041
but you and I have unfinished business.

735
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,416
Let's go to a hotel.

736
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:54,833
Don't play hard to get,
or your brother will--

737
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:58,125
You want to fight me?

738
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:06,958
No way.

739
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:17,875
Boss, hey. Boss!

740
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:28,583
Sirno Peteng is born
to carry out noble tasks.

741
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:33,125
So you can't use it as you please.

742
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,041
Your aura exudes anger.

743
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,833
That means…

744
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:47,958
Sirno Peteng asked you
to clean the heirloom.

745
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:53,833
Just as your ancestors did.

746
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,416
Take good care of it.

747
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:07,375
Because it chose you.

748
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:14,541
You will draw strength from it.

749
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,875
As you also will…

750
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:21,000
make sacrifices for it.

751
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,666
Accept it sincerely.

752
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:35,541
Alin Wihanggamapati.
