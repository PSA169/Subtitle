3
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,684
They say when you die,

4
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,294
your life flashes
before your eyes.

5
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,213
The people you loved...

6
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,745
The good moments...

7
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,535
And the bad...

8
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,667
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,842
I'm so sorry.

10
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,281
My memories
are a confusing blur.

11
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,674
Maybe it's for the best.

12
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,811
Because right now, my life is
something I'd rather forget.

13
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,314
As
cases surge globally

14
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:22,272
more than tripling
in the last week,

15
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:25,057
most governments have issued
shelter in place orders

16
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,582
for all non-essential workers.

17
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:30,889
Despite ongoing uncertainty
as to the virus' source,

18
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,154
the scientific community
agrees, the transmission occurs-

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,591
Hey, you all right?

20
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,987
Jesus Christ.

21
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,686
Another alert.

22
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,643
Nearby.

23
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,472
We left too late.

24
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:50,909
The three
early warning signs of infection

25
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,781
are severe headaches-

26
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,219
Ethan, I can drive.

27
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,342
Hello?

28
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,753
Emma!

29
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,146
Where is everyone?

30
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,104
Hello!

31
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:06,942
Emma!

32
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,077
Hello!

33
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,270
Hey, hey!

34
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,327
You lost?

35
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,548
Yeah, I just woke up, I
don't know where the fuck I am.

36
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,387
Come on, get out here!

37
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,344
Okay.

38
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,788
Shit.

39
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,181
You blind bitch.

40
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,145
I don't even know these guys,

41
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,582
I'm just looking
for my girlfriend.

42
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,981
Stop staring, it's rude.

43
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,377
You shouldn't be out here alone.

44
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,510
You are.

45
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,033
Yeah. Well, I'm not an idiot.

46
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,775
Okay.

47
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,825
I was in a car
accident, I was with Emma,

48
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,348
we were driving to the lake.

49
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:19,961
Yes!

50
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:23,617
Where are we?

51
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,401
Gimme a hand.

52
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,840
What if he wakes up?

53
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:33,627
Happy?

54
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,243
You okay?

55
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,854
Yeah, yeah, I just...

56
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,811
Look who
finally woke up.

57
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,469
How's your head?

58
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,256
I'm...

59
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,172
I'm Mae.

60
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:26,566
I'm Ethan.

61
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:28,959
You sure?

62
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,095
I've got amnesia.

63
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,052
No shit.

64
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,449
I left some clothes for
you on top of the dresser.

65
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,190
You must have missed them.

66
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,889
Unless this is a style choice.

67
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,588
I'll be right back.

68
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,528
Ooh, looking good.

69
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,707
It smells delicious.

70
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,709
It's not ready,
do not touch it.

71
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,931
My generator.

72
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,064
Kinetic energy.

73
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,240
Clever boy.

74
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,418
So what do you remember?

75
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,558
My girlfriend
and I gathered our supplies

76
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,343
and headed to our cabin.

77
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,040
We were gonna wait it out there.

78
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,739
It's isolated, safe.

79
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,046
And hopefully she's
there waiting for me.

80
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:18,329
A piece of advice, keep
your amnesia to yourself.

81
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,897
People today are looking
for weaknesses in others.

82
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:25,467
What happened?

83
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,209
Well, we've
been threatening

84
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,864
to let viruses wipe
us out for years.

85
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,561
One finally called our bluff.

86
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,391
Some say it's the planet's
attempt to reclaim balance

87
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,523
by killing us all off.

88
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,524
In days?

89
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,353
How is that possible?

90
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,616
Nature's a powerful bitch.

91
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,011
Fuck!

92
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,534
I'll be right back.

93
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,927
Don't touch anything.

94
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,670
Mae?

95
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,199
I should probably head out.

96
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:12,906
Hey!

97
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,559
What did I say?

98
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,257
Don't touch anything!

99
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,653
Who are you?

100
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:07,874
Mae?

101
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,943
Mae, there's something
or someone over there.

102
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,904
That's Myrtle, she's fine,
just don't get too close.

103
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,297
Shouldn't we-

104
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,516
I said she's fine.

105
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:42,517
Live and let live.

106
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:48,828
Geez.

107
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,616
Can I help?

108
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,618
You an expert with generators?

109
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,056
Actually, I think I am.

110
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,543
Have at it.

111
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,030
Well, what do you think?

112
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,599
First of all, whoever
set this up is an idiot.

113
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,687
No offense.

114
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,732
None taken.

115
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,570
Way to go!

116
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,876
Hey, hey, hey.

117
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,401
That ego of yours is
going to your head.

118
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,709
Okay, come on, let's
move it and shake it.

119
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,150
Mae, I wasn't kidding, I
need to go and find Emma.

120
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,518
We're gonna to
eat good tonight.

121
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,087
Is that a possum?

122
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,046
Are you alone out here?

123
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,004
Most days.

124
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,442
You have a husband?

125
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,443
You got a point?

126
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,490
Oh, just wondering if
it's safe out here alone.

127
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,492
I'm not alone, I got Myrtle.

128
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,774
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna kill you.

129
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,820
I know.

130
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,343
Besides, look at me,

131
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,476
you could beat me
to death with ease.

132
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't want that.

133
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,785
But do not go snooping around,

134
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,700
unless you have a
death wish, okay?

135
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,007
Because every room in
here is booby-trapped.

136
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:05,877
I mean it.

137
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,053
Define booby-

138
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:08,880
Jesus!

139
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,275
What are you doing?

140
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,061
Shoot me.

141
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,106
No.

142
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,371
Good boy.

143
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,677
You see that?

144
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,461
Red means dead.

145
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:27,160
If you pulled that trigger,
I'd be dead right now.

146
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,509
Hungry?

147
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,430
That was really good.

148
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,042
It's getting kind of
late, I should probably-

149
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,913
Ethan, you know,
I hate to ask you this,

150
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,699
but I could just
really use your help.

151
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:47,745

Really?

170
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:28,455

Listen, Mae, I
should probably-

177
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,494
You play cards?

178
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,593
Two of hearts.

179
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:29,777
No, thanks, I'm good.

180
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,695
Harder to kill
when you're sober.

181
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,219
That's okay.

182
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,481
I love a challenge.

183
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,614
Maybe you've had enough.

184
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,144
Bullshit.

185
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,151
Gotcha.

186
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,024
I used to be
good at this game.

187
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,852
Yeah, well,
you're a terrible liar.

188
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:05,116
Your face, no secrets.
- Yeah?

189
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,248
What about your face?

190
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,212
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

191
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,169
Yeah.

192
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,606
It's getting late.

193
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,312
Mae, I appreciate you
taking me in, feeding me,

194
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,922
but I promised Emma-

195
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,880
Nothing good happens
after dark, Ethan.

196
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,057
I promised Emma,
I would protect her.

197
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,450
Have a good night's sleep.

198
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,756
We'll find her tomorrow.

199
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,847
Trust me, Myrtle is the least
of your worries out there.

200
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,852
This is where you say thank you.

201
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,809
Thank you.

202
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,768
You're welcome.

203
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,509
Good night.

204
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,554
Go to bed.

205
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,706
Say it back.

206
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:17,014
If we ever get separated, meet
at the cabin, Candle Lake.

207
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,712
Got it.

208
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:49,672
Wake up.

209
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,539
Emma.

210
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:32,759
Emma!

211
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,448
Who are you?

212
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,538
What are you doing here?

213
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,757
Drop it.

214
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,892
Sam.

215
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,070
Stay there, honey.

216
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,463
I don't want any trouble.

217
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,247
I'm just looking
for my girlfriend.

218
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,467
- Emma?
- Yes.

219
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,990
Have you seen her?
- No.

220
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,168
You are out there yelling
her name like an idiot.

221
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,115
Okay.

222
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,814
Eyes closed.

223
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:55,771
Yeah?

224
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,351
How is it still alive?

225
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,048
I bashed its skull in.

226
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,136
Alive.

227
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,355
That's generous.

228
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,054
Out here, most are
pretty far gone,

229
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:22,319
more plant than people now,

230
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,975
so yeah, head kills
don't really work.

231
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,288
If I had any bullets,
you'd already be dead.

232
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:38,161
Oh, appreciate the honesty.

233
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,295
What do they want?

234
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,645
Same as
any of us, I guess.

235
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,603
Food.

236
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,084
Mostly food.

237
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:58,007
I'm Jolene.

238
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,531
That's my son, Sam.

239
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,100
Ethan.

240
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,104
Where'd you get a cast?

241
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,241
I was in an accident
and my girlfriend Emma,

242
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,242
she's a doctor.

243
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,026
A doctor.

244
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:19,768
That's lucky.

245
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,426
When's the last
time you saw her?

246
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,646
A few days.

247
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,823
I hate
to break it to you,

248
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,912
but we have been here for weeks
and I haven't seen anyone,

249
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,742
except the plant parade.

250
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,050
She'll be here.

251
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,182
This is our spot.

252
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,184
Yeah, don't be so sure.

253
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:49,668
It's just...

254
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,019
Hope is dangerous.

255
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,631
He thinks his dad
is coming back.

256
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,982
What happened to him?

257
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,071
The same thing
that happened to everyone.

258
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,552
I made a choice.

259
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:28,445
Distract me, Ethan,
tell me something good.

260
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,187
Like what?

261
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,494
You and Emma.

262
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,677
This may sound weird,
and I know it's not true,

263
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,114
but I feel like I've
known her my whole life.

264
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,639
When I close my eyes
and I think of her,

265
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,904
it's not the big
moments that stand out,

266
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:54,994
it's the dumb little things.

267
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:03,089
I think of how we take care of
each other, amuse each other,

268
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,568
even in the bad times.

269
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,704
Unfortunately, in our
dumpster fire of a world,

270
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,011
the bad times started
to overshadow the good.

271
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:16,493
Wherever you turned,
people were at their worst,

272
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:19,932
violent, cruel, fed up.

273
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,460
Honestly, when I heard
the virus was plant-based,

274
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,766
I wasn't surprised.

275
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,553
It's like the planet finally
had enough of our shit.

276
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,688
Hey.

277
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,996
After
the deadliest day yet,

278
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:44,086
social media is dubbing the
infected, "The Reclaimed"

279
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,175
based on a popular
conspiracy theory

280
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,223
that nature is purging itself
from mankind's destruction.

281
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:53,922
Disturbing visuals are going
viral at an alarming rate.

282
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,881
Is she okay?

283
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,753
Shit, that looks bad.

284
00:29:58,753 --> 00:29:59,841
Excuse me.

285
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:04,237
Whatever this is,
it's not turning around.

286
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,891
We need to get the
hell outta here.

287
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:09,068
Tonight.

288
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,286
We got out.

289
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,332
I remember that much.

290
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,164
Ethan.

291
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,426
Ethan.
- Yeah?

292
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,384
You can sleep.

293
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,171
I'm good.

294
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:27,869
Honestly, I'll
take the first watch.

295
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,393
I'm not even tired.

296
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,228
Ethan.

297
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,186
Yeah.

298
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,931
If you mess with me or
my kid, I'll kill you.

299
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:48,890
Okay?

300
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:10,869
Ethan, what's wrong?

301
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,743
If anything goes sideways,
meet at the cabin.

302
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,832
Wake up.

303
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,195
Ethan!

304
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,210
Hey, just try to relax.

305
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,342
Was that a person?

306
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,344
Used to be.

307
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,483
Was that necessary?

308
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,658
Yeah, actually.

309
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,879
These things are unstoppable.

310
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,315
I just bought us some time.

311
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,578
Stay here.

312
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,372
Find what you're looking for?

313
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,679
My name is Mae by the way.

314
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:47,346
Hi, baby.

315
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:54,788
If you're watching this,
I'm guessing we're apart.

316
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,704
You're probably confused.

317
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:02,361
Well, more so than usual.

318
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,417
Your amnesia, your
amnesia is getting worse.

319
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:17,506
Erratic.

320
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,162
I keep losing you.

321
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,300
I mean, I don't know
if I can keep this up.

322
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,182
The world isn't
what it used to be.

323
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:46,883
People are changing
for the worst.

324
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,453
I guess what I'm saying
is if you're lost

325
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,240
and I'm not with you-

326
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:00,854
- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey!

327
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,334
Don't do that!

328
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:03,944
You will draw them
out, I'm serious.

329
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,381
I'm serious.

330
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,644
I have a charger
back at my place.

331
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,430
It's okay, come on, let's go.

332
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,962
Wow, nice truck.

333
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,529
Well, it would be

334
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:25,748
if some idiot hadn't
drained the battery.

335
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,406
What?

336
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:32,755
I'm gonna wipe your face.

337
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:44,158
Sorry I was weird back there.

338
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,205
I have amnesia.
- Yeah, I know.

339
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,119
We've done this before.

340
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,077
We have?

341
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,604
How are you feeling?

342
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:56,823
My head is swimming.

343
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:59,434
I'm Ethan, by the way.

344
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,175
Mae, like I said.

345
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:06,398
Well, let's charge that
phone of yours, shall we?

346
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:16,582
Oh, shit.

347
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,498
Fuck!

348
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:20,977
Can you get another pair?

349
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,242
Do you know how many
people I had to kill

350
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,417
for that prescription?

351
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:29,377
Hop on.

352
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,292
Hop on?

353
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,034
Get on the back of the bike.

354
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:36,515
Let's go.

355
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:37,472
Come on.

356
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:41,781
Steady right there.

357
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,565
Okay, put your feet up.
- Okay.

358
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:44,958
Lift your feet up.

359
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,002
They're
up, they're up.

360
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,370
How far is your house?
- Far enough.

361
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,155
You wanna switch?

362
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,419
You're dreaming if I think
I'm gonna let you drive.

363
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,661
My feet are killing me.

364
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,447
I hope this stupid girl
of yours is worth it.

365
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:40,492
She is.

366
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,625
What's so funny?

367
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:47,934
I don't know, you
just seem so fired up.

368
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:49,849
I am.

369
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,634
I'm not stopping
until I find her.

370
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,464
Don't you have anyone?

371
00:38:58,945 --> 00:38:59,859
Sort of.

372
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:01,861
He died.

373
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:08,520
I'm sorry.

374
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,477
No, you're not.

375
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,878
What's your story?

376
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:21,489
What's my story?

377
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:23,578
Are you serious?

378
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:29,367
Do you really care or are
you just making small talk?

379
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:33,371
I need a distraction
from my thoughts, I guess.

380
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:35,895
At least you're honest.

381
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:39,594
My story.

382
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,119
I don't know.

383
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,077
I live alone.

384
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,516
I have a great garden.

385
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:53,652
I hunt and I take in strangers.

386
00:39:57,003 --> 00:40:00,398
Tell me something
personal, something real.

387
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:10,016
I'm lonely and kind
of wish I was dead.

388
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,976
- That's a-
- An overshare?

389
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,239
An overshare.

390
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,896
You asked me.

391
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,473
You okay?

392
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,227
This
is not a test.

393
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,664
This is the emergency
alert system

394
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:35,057
reporting a mandatory
evacuation order

395
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,059
for all local residents.

396
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,192
Gather food, water,
and medical supplies.

397
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,889
Okay, 30 seconds tops.

398
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,500
This place looks sketchy.

399
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:48,897
Well?

400
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,029
What do you think?

401
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,424
Admit it, we're fucked.

402
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:57,210
We'll be okay,
I'll protect us.

403
00:41:58,428 --> 00:41:59,778
More like the
other way around.

404
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,011
Emma!

405
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,289
You actually did it!

406
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,466
Don't sound so surprised.

407
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:41,950
You okay?

408
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,825
My name is Mae.

409
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,047
I know.

410
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:54,746
I must have tripped is all.

411
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:57,096
No, you passed
out, that's what happened.

412
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,578
Are you sure you're okay?

413
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:03,450
I'm fine.

414
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,931
I'm just hungry, I think.

415
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:37,223
Finally.

416
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:56,634
What?

417
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:04,250
Hey!

418
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:06,818
We're armed.

419
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,038
Get out or I will shoot you!

420
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:12,084
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

421
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:15,565
Please, I rather you didn't.

422
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,700
I just, I saw your
house, you had power.

423
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,310
I just, I figured-

424
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,051
- You'd break in.
- No, I knocked.

425
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:26,402
But you know how it is, it
could have been abandoned.

426
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:30,842
I'm Tom.

427
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:32,017
And you are?

428
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:33,671
Skeptical.

429
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,368
That's fair.

430
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,325
'Sup?

431
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,328
You alone?

432
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:45,204
I lost my wife, like
somewhere in the area

433
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:48,686
and I'm just, I'm looking
for her, you know?

434
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,123
You got a gun?

435
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,734
No.

436
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,306
Out here you don't have a
gun, are you fucking stupid?

437
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,656
Come on, lady, now
you're just being mean.

438
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,094
I have one gun.

439
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:08,706
Just one.
- Just one?

440
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,620
That's it.

441
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,361
I promise.

442
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,234
Pat him down.

443
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:31,206
You wanna tell your
mom to chill out?

444
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:32,468
She's not my mom.

445
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,954
Look, I didn't come here
for any trouble, all right?

446
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:42,522
I'm just, I'm
looking for answers.

447
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,829
And honestly, any
food you could spare,

448
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,092
I mean, you know how tough
it is out here, right?

449
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:48,136
Or maybe you don't.

450
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,922
I mean, you have kale.

451
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,317
You know, Tom,
trust is earned.

452
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:59,582
One hot meal in
exchange for one chore.

453
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,280
You got it?

454
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,457
Yeah.

455
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:05,588
Define chore.

456
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,591
Well, I hate to
ask, but it's rare

457
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,811
that I have two strong
men at my disposal.

458
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,858
There's a few things
I can't do by myself.

459
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:17,600
I'm yours.

460
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,523
Hey, did you also think she
was gonna ask for a three-way?

461
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:29,351
What?

462
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:30,352
No.

463
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:31,223
I'm just kidding.

464
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,792
How do you two know each other?

465
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:36,750
I lost someone too.

466
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,143
She's helping me find her.

467
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:40,667
Sorry to hear.

468
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,761
You all right?

469
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,143
I'm gonna go take a leak,
I'll be back in one second.

470
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,285
Hey, boys.

471
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,424
Wow, lemonade.

472
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:45,601
Fresh lemons.

473
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,658
- Anything else in here?
- Just poison.

474
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:01,052
Who's hungry?

475
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:08,363
Hey, do you have
anywhere I can wash up?

476
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,409
Yeah, there's a
sink right here.

477
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:11,453
Help yourself.
- Thank you.

478
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:12,759
It smells great.

479
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:13,716
Thank you.

480
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,286
Say you're not hungry.

481
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:19,635
I'm starving, I can
barely see straight.

482
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:20,941
Say you're not hungry.

483
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,116
I'll cook for you later.
- Mae.

484
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,031
Do what I fucking say.

485
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:24,989
Let's eat.

486
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:42,789
God damn, Mae, I haven't
eaten like this in years.

487
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:43,746
You're welcome.

488
00:48:47,402 --> 00:48:48,229
Wow.

489
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:49,274
Hello.

490
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:50,971
Is that your stomach?

491
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,886
Are you sure you don't want any?

492
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,498
I'm good.

493
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:58,544
I'm just not hungry.

494
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:03,375
Why don't we finish
this bottle of wine off?

495
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,376
What do you think?

496
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:06,030
Me and you?

497
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:06,987
Who am I to say no?

498
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:11,252
Welcome.

499
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:14,777
I'm gonna clear these plates.

500
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,997
Let me, excuse me, let
me grab that from you.

501
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,956
Thank you.

502
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:29,096
When was the last time
you saw her, your girl?

503
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:31,229
I don't know you.

504
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,841
Has it been days, weeks?

505
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:43,241
This is Frannie, Fran, my lady.

506
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:48,202
She wouldn't fall
prey to the reclaimed,

507
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:51,336
but she just
disappeared 10 days ago.

508
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,643
She was foraging in the area,

509
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,211
mentioned seeing a
house with power.

510
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:59,039
That's the last time I saw her.

511
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,956
In old times, if you
were gone for two weeks,

512
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:04,479
I mean, you're considered dead.

513
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,786
There's no question about it.

514
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:11,225
But now, with no
communication, you never know,

515
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:14,533
your person, they could
be out there for years.

516
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:16,970
And unfortunately, the
reality is sometimes

517
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,668
you're better off not
finding them at all.

518
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,803
Hey, it's okay.

519
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,065
Let's get you into
the other room.

520
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:26,980
Come on.

521
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,503
You're gonna need
to eat something, my friend.

522
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,595
- Hey.
- I just need to take a nap.

523
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:35,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

524
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:37,686
Help me get him up.

525
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:39,688
Hey, hey.

526
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:41,995
Okay.

527
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:45,477
Hey, Mae.

528
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:50,134
I will take that gun.

529
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:05,105
This is a nice piece
of hardware, grandma.

530
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:08,935
I'll take that back when
you're done, of course.

531
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:09,936
But of course.

532
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:13,113
What did you do to him?

533
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:16,899
I promise you, I'm
not fucking around.

534
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:21,121
You do think I'm stupid.

535
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,123
No.

536
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,695
I think you're sleepy.

537
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:35,962
You did it.

538
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:37,833
You crazy bitch,
you did poison me.

539
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,009
No, I sedated you.

540
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,926
Fun fact about Ativan.

541
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:45,493
Yeah?

542
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:47,582
It works way past
its expiration date,

543
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,454
but it does have
some side effects.

544
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:52,718
Yeah, what's that?

545
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:56,200
Headaches.

546
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,160
Ethan, Ethan.

547
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,510
Hey, hey, stay with me, okay?

548
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,729
Stay with me.

549
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:06,035
I'll be right back.

550
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:06,993
Fuck.

551
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:25,664
Ethan, it's okay, stay
calm, I'll be right there.

552
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,427
Tom.

553
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:51,255
Tom.

554
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:59,306
Coming, Ethan.

555
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:00,351
Mae, run!

556
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:05,051
I hope you don't mind,
we let ourselves in.

557
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,095
Grab the gun.

558
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:22,808
It's insulin.

559
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:23,983
I'm a diabetic.

560
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,118
Keep lying.

561
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,688
Maybe
we should shoot him.

562
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:35,429
See how she reacts.

563
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:38,040
Yeah, go ahead, see if I care.

564
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,433
He's just another sucker.

565
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,090
Wait, wait.

566
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:46,745
No.

567
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:52,968
We're gonna search
this entire house

568
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:56,494
and we're gonna find some
proof that Frannie was here.

569
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,322
And then we're gonna
fucking kill you.

570
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,760
You, let's go.

571
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,153
I'm gonna search every
room in this house.

572
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,590
Wolf, watch her.

573
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,547
She's a lot.

574
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,774
I'm telling you,
Ethan, she drugged us,

575
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,212
she killed our wives.

576
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:23,129
You don't know that.

577
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,826
Wake up, kid!

578
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,480
She's not who you think she is.

579
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:30,658
We just gotta find proof.

580
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,321
I'll make it quick
if you help speed this up.

581
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:42,975
Where's the fun in that?

582
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,979
That's my kind of girl.

583
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,378
God dammit!

584
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:57,990
Next room!

585
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,735
What's in the barn?

586
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:05,563
Dirt.

587
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:10,481
She's nervous.

588
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,441
No, it's just my
resting bitch face.

589
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,836
Let's see about that.

590
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,708
Keep an eye on her.

591
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,952
Hey, this will go
a lot faster if you helped.

592
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:51,870
Is that yours?

593
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,530
It was Emma's.

594
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,184
Sorry to
hear that, brother.

595
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,883
Let's go do something about it.

596
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:42,616
Hey, I think
I found something.

597
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:46,620
Hey, Mae, you
wanna explain this?

598
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,537
What are these, kill trophies?

599
00:56:51,973 --> 00:56:53,453
Wait.

600
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,413
Tom.

601
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,631
What?

602
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,677
Isn't that Frannie's?

603
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,949
Hey, hey, Ethan.

604
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:58,910
Ethan, put the gun down.

605
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,302
You killed Emma.

606
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:04,219
No.

607
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,177
No, I didn't.

608
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,267
Is she dead?

609
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,529
Ethan.

610
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,533
Look at me.

611
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:14,665
Is she dead?

612
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,454
When?

613
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:30,028
A long, long time ago.

614
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,127
Grab Wolf.

615
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:43,389
Let's finish this.

616
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:45,957
How long have I had amnesia?

617
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,091
You have amnesia?

618
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:54,008
That's very interesting, Mae.

619
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,882
Hey, kid, can you tell
me about your accident?

620
00:58:57,882 --> 00:58:59,884
Did you break your arm?

621
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:01,059
You remember?

622
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:02,103
Can you tell me about it?

623
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:04,802
I'll take that.

624
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:13,506
What are we gonna find in there?

625
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:15,552
Is that where you put her?

626
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:18,467
My wife?

627
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:30,088
You tell him or I will.

628
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,786
Tell me what?

629
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:42,361
Hey,
Wolf, what'd you find?

630
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:46,583
Am I sick?

631
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:49,629
No, you're not.

632
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,675
You're not sick, Ethan.

633
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,201
You're dead.

634
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,337
Hey.

635
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:12,957
It's Hunter!

636
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:50,342
Just try to breathe.

637
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:53,911
You said you wanted
your gun back, right?

638
01:00:55,782 --> 01:00:58,306
Let's start with the bullets.

639
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:57,975
It's okay.

640
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,602
Don't worry, you won't remember.

641
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:59,427
Hey.

642
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:05,172
How'd you sleep?

643
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,703
Good, I think.

644
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:18,533
Do you remember me?

645
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:22,537
No.

646
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,802
Do you know who I am?

647
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:28,805
A friend?

648
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,160
We're running out of food.

649
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,031
I need to hunt, I
could use your help.

650
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:38,902
Sure.

651
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,033
Get dressed.

652
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,165
I'll meet you downstairs.

653
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,619
Hey, where'd you go?

654
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:03,840
Where'd I what?

655
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,493
You gotta stay with me, okay?

656
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:10,847
Don't, just leave it.

657
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:13,240
You should go.

658
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:15,460
Leave me.

659
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,116
Never, you hear me?

660
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:24,599
Okay, just try to keep up.

661
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:40,572
If there's anyone, just
let me do the talking.

662
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:52,758
Hello?

663
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,372
We come in peace.

664
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:02,202
Says a gal with a gun.

665
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:06,119
It's for protection.

666
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,165
Oh, I understand.

667
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:10,384
In fact, I got some
protection of my own.

668
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:13,910
Not that.

669
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,131
I was referring to the skilled,
tiny person with a pistol

670
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:19,524
pointed at your heads.

671
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:22,396
Hi.

672
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:24,094
- Hi.
- Hi.

673
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:25,399
Why don't we start
with some introductions?

674
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:26,357
I'm Kai.

675
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:28,315
That's my home.

676
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:32,711
And that pretty darling
right there is Caroline.

677
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,061
I like to call her,
"Little Miss Never Miss."

678
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,151
I'm Emma, and this is Ethan.

679
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:43,113
She always do
all the talking, Ethan?

680
01:05:43,113 --> 01:05:44,505
I can speak for myself.

681
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,030
I'd say that too.

682
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:54,211
We'd be grateful for
anything, for food, shelter.

683
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:55,168
Please.

684
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:58,780
Where you coming from?

685
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,131
We were in a crash.

686
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:05,918
Either of you sick?

687
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:10,488
Prove it.

688
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,578
Take your clothes off.

689
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,150
That's my offer,
take it or leave it.

690
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:38,255
Pants too.

691
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:40,605
Come on, man.

692
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,923
You happy?

693
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,797
I don't know, what
do you think, Caroline?

694
01:06:58,797 --> 01:07:01,104
They look normal.

695
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,061
Normal.

696
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:07,240
Run in and tell mama bear
we have some company.

697
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,503
Why are they naked?

698
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:11,070
You know why.

699
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,550
What's our motto?

700
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,247
Trust, but verify.

701
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:16,684
Trust, but verify,
that's right.

702
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:18,817
'Cause of
what happened to Bobby.

703
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:22,647
Run inside now.

704
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,347
You can get dressed.

705
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:29,132
Go ahead.

706
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:36,052
There are rules, you break
'em, you're gone, or worse.

707
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,141
- Understood.
- Good.

708
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,882
Let's get you kids fed.

709
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:43,885
You okay?

710
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:06,821
Thank you, sweetheart.

711
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:09,694
I imagine you two are thirsty.

712
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:14,829
We have a well on the property,

713
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,962
it's not pretty, but it's safe.

714
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:19,095
Unless you like
something a bit stronger.

715
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:23,969
No, thank you.

716
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,930
Nice cabinet.

717
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:33,935
Oh, yeah, we had a barn
collapse on the property.

718
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:36,808
You know, just the
usual decay and time.

719
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:42,335
I didn't want to let her go
so I dismantled and denailed

720
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:44,207
and before you know it,
I got a coffee table here

721
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:45,251
and shelves there.

722
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:47,166
I reclaimed it.

723
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,865
Kind of like what the
planet's doing to us,

724
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:54,565
if you believe what the
news says, which I don't.

725
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,874
"The Reclaimed."

726
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,702
I mean, for wood,
it makes sense,

727
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:03,791
you know, you repurpose
something that's lost,

728
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,403
but for people, nah.

729
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,710
Seems a bit defeatist.

730
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,016
Maybe we deserve it.

731
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:14,976
I mean, look at what
we've done to this planet,

732
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:15,934
to each other.

733
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:21,722
You're not a religious
person, are you Emma?

734
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:26,814
"Though He slay
me, I hope in Him"

735
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:32,516
It's Job, Chapter
13 from the Bible.

736
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,302
That's a dangerous
thing, you know,

737
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:38,913
thinking the worst about people,

738
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:41,133
especially in times like these.

739
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:42,700
Easy for you to say.

740
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:48,662
After the last couple weeks,
hope is in short supply.

741
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,317
You know, I'm
sure you two have seen

742
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,537
your share of horrible things,

743
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:56,670
but I can assure you,

744
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,847
you do not have the market
cornered on suffering.

745
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:09,248
Anyway, maybe this
thing, whatever it
is, is a wake up call,

746
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,032
put us back into our places.

747
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:15,123
Now, think about it, think
about the last 100 years,

748
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:18,475
50 years, what we're capable of.

749
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,480
Maybe this is forcing us to
get back to what matters,

750
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:29,486
what's simple, faith, the
land, the water, family.

751
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,362
Papa, dinner soon.

752
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:39,844
Anyway, I'm sorry,
I get a little philosophical

753
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:41,846
when I drink.

754
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:47,155
All right, let's eat.

755
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,376
Hey, hey, sit.

756
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:53,249
You're gonna spook the deer.

757
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,665
Finally, got one.

758
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,288
It's close, but
you got the heart wrong.

759
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,164
Yeah, yeah.

760
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:40,774
I ran out of red markers.

761
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,214
How many times?

762
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,742
Ethan, it's complicated.

763
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:55,049
- I have time.
- No, you don't have time.

764
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:56,921
You need to feed.

765
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:08,367
You actually did it.

766
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,023
Don't sound so surprised.

767
01:12:13,764 --> 01:12:14,678
Ethan!

768
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:39,050
Your body is changing

769
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,706
And when you feed,
it halts the process,

770
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:44,882
and then you remember.

771
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,153
Please, no!

772
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,031
It's okay, it's okay.

773
01:13:04,031 --> 01:13:06,904
Don't look, it's
okay, it's okay.

774
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:08,819
Ethan.

775
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:11,169
Stay with me.

776
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:21,266
Stop that starin', Caroline.

777
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:23,355
Yes, Papa.

778
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:33,757
Our guests are
starving, sweetheart.

779
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:38,152
Now, these are
real farm to table,

780
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:40,633
grown right outside in the back.

781
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:44,202
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

782
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:45,159
It sure does.

783
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,991
It's the least we could do

784
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:52,776
after Caroline
pulled a gun on you.

785
01:13:52,776 --> 01:13:55,300
Oh, we're well
past that, right, Caroline?

786
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:01,785
Shall we say grace?

787
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,665
Actually, maybe
I should wash up.

788
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:13,884
- Oh.
- Oh.

789
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:15,538
Where are my manners?

790
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,844
Upstairs, second
door to the left.

791
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:20,020
We'll be right back.

792
01:14:24,764 --> 01:14:27,941
Are you sure
they're okay, sweetie.

793
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:37,168
Lord, these are
troubled times.

794
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:40,824
We've been led astray.

795
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:43,479
Now, more than ever, your
flock needs guidance.

796
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:46,482
Over to you sweetheart.

797
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,049
Bless us, oh Lord,

798
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:50,921
for these gifts that
we are about to receive

799
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,359
from the bounty of
Christ, our Lord.

800
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:56,666
Amen.

801
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,016
Amen.

802
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:02,062
I can't do this.

803
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:06,327
Yes, yes, you can.

804
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:09,200
I'm gonna buy us
some time, okay?

805
01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:14,074
Don't leave.

806
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,164
Look at me.

807
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:18,296
Never, okay?

808
01:15:21,473 --> 01:15:23,519
Hey, I'll be right back.

809
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:38,185
Is everything okay?

810
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:39,709
Oh, yeah, yeah.

811
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:44,148
Thank you again for
your hospitality.

812
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:45,279
Of course.

813
01:15:46,324 --> 01:15:47,238
We're happy to.

814
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:51,242
Sweetheart, why don't you to
take Caroline and go outside?

815
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,159
Kai.

816
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:58,118
Sit down.

817
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,250
Kai, maybe we should
talk about this.

818
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,165
Do it now, go on.

819
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:03,950
It's okay, sweetheart.

820
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,433
It's okay, love.

821
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:19,531
Put your filthy
hands on the table.

822
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:25,668
Ethan needed to
use the restroom.

823
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,104
Where is your gun?

824
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:36,243
You know, I don't
know all the symptoms,

825
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:38,115
but that boy's lost.

826
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:39,290
He's soulless.

827
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,858
Doesn't even know his name.

828
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:43,642
He's got that amnesia.

829
01:16:43,642 --> 01:16:46,950
- If maybe we could just-
- He don't look sick.

830
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:47,994
Just tired.

831
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:52,172
Is that how you fool
all your victims,

832
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,348
all the innocent people
like me and my family?

833
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,480
Is that what you do?

834
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:04,271
How long you been feeding him?

835
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,146
He's all I have left.

836
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,844
Oh, you are the devil.

837
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,541
You are.

838
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:16,457
Does he even know what he is?

839
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:17,415
Does he?

840
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:22,855
See, you're just as infected
as he is, with weakness.

841
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:25,902
Ethan.

842
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:29,688
Are you okay, dear?

843
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:01,780
Emma.

844
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,868
You're Emma.

845
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:08,395
How long have you
been doing this?

846
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:11,224
Too long.

847
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,096
Look at me.

848
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:22,322
You have to eat daily, human
flesh and it can't be rotten.

849
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:30,635
I had to get creative
feeding you, which actually,

850
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:33,943
thanks to your amnesia,
wasn't that hard.

851
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,905
When you eat with regularity,

852
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:42,212
you are like the
fountain of youth.

853
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:48,000
But your memory's
inconsistent, unreliable.

854
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:51,177
Sometimes it returns right away,

855
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:53,440
and sometimes it takes longer.

856
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:59,882
It sounds horrible, I know,
but as long as I kept you clean

857
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,146
and fed, we were almost okay.

858
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,933
For a while, we had
a good thing going.

859
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:12,677
In a twisted way, it was
like time stood still,

860
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,680
a permanent honeymoon.

861
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,249
Then, weeks became years,

862
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:23,906
and one day, you
stopped recognizing me.

863
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:38,442
Good morning, lazy bones.

864
01:20:40,052 --> 01:20:43,055
Hey.

865
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,623
I'm sorry.

866
01:20:45,623 --> 01:20:46,580
What?

867
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:52,108
Then, I started
the full-time charade.

868
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:56,242
You know, you caught
on a few times.

869
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:57,417
Wait, are you Emma?

870
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:01,769
But as the years
passed, less and less.

871
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:07,558
I'm a monster.

872
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:09,125
No, you're the new normal.

873
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:13,433
I'm the one facing extinction.

874
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:17,307
You should let me die.

875
01:21:18,308 --> 01:21:19,700
That's the problem.

876
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,269
I did.

877
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:30,015
My body is broken.

878
01:21:31,103 --> 01:21:32,322
I'm broken.

879
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:35,629
I can't do this anymore.

880
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,245
Me neither.

881
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,641
Ethan, stop.
