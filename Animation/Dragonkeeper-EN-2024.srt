00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,748
<i>Only you can help us.</i>

368
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,118
Me? But I'm just a servant.

369
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,453
<i>You are not a servant, Ping.</i>

370
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,622

00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,140
[Ping breathing heavily]

376
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,878
What is that?

377
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,114
The Dragon Stone.

378
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,884
One of the Honored Guests
has died.

379
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,653
No, Ping!

380
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,254
Ping, wait!
Wait! Stay here!

381
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,591
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Lao Ma] Don't go out there!

382
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:57,625
What is it?

383
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,862
[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

384
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,333
[Master Lan] Hurry!

385
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,402
We have to get the body out
before it loses its quality!

386
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:12,006
You are making me lose money!

387
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,075
Quickly, men!

388
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,710
Hurry up! Hurry up!

389
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,979

[horse neighs]

392
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:41,401
Bring me
something to carve it up.

393
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,337
Get to task with it.

394
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,808
[continues indistinctly]

395
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,544

[Master Lan]
Don't damage the scales.

[continues indistinctly]
[Hua Hua squeaking]

399
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:01,289
Don't look. [sobbing]

[dragon] <i>Help us, Ping.</i>

401
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,132

402
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,735
[sobs] I can't.

403
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,738
[Ping crying softly]

00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,310
[Ping gasps]

415
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,345
Watch where you're going, girl,

416
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,181
if you don't want to get hurt.

417
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:40,755
Ping, where were you last night?

418
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,124
-I...
-Never mind.

419
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,426
Take this to
the Great Lord in the main room

420
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,930
and don't do anything silly.

421
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:53,668
He is from Chang'an,
from the Imperial Palace.

422
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,836
Hurry, hurry!

423
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:00,007
[Master Lan] No, no! Have mercy!

424
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:02,442
Your excellency, please!

425
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,278
It's not my fault!
I didn't kill it!

426
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:05,680
You must understand.
It's all the iron.

427
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,281
-It poisons them, I beg of you!
-You there.

428
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:10,384
-[Master Lan] Have mercy!
-Don't let it go cold.

429
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:11,752
[man] It's not going to be easy

430
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,854
to bring
the dragon into the cage.

431
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,656
It's too risky, Master Diao.

432
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,425
We need to clear
the ice and bring the cage

433
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:18,826
before the inner gates.

434
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,763
The iron here
blocks the dragon's magic.

435
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:25,933
Surely your man
can handle Long Danzi

436
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,835
in his weakened condition.

437
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,838
[man] To kill him
would be easy enough, but...

438
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:34,208
to force him into that cage
is another matter entirely.

439
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,877
Long Danzi must
reach Chang'an alive.

440
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,081
[grunts] His blood must
be fresh for the ritual.

441
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:44,151
[man] We can't
underestimate the dragon.

442
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:47,388
Well, don't just
stand there, girl.

443
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,956
Bring it here.

444
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,794
The Emperor's life
hangs in the balance.

445
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:57,765
I'm afraid we must
be on our way tomorrow.

446
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:03,170
Haven't you been
taught any manners, girl?

447
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:07,141
Do you not know how
to use your right hand?

448
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,510
Or is it something else?

449
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:10,711
[Hua Hua squeaking]

450
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,346
[Ping gasps]
[Hua Hua squeaks]

451
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,585
Perhaps a left-handed
girl in a house of dragons.

452
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,920
It can't be a coincidence.

453
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,288
[Hua Hua squeaking]

454
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:22,690
[Ping gasps]

455
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,027

[pot clatters]

457
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,000
[gasps] Wha...what?

458
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,470
[Diao chuckles]

459
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,239
Well, well, well.

460
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,510
I think we may have
just discovered the solution

461
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,644
to your problem, Captain.

462
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:47,581
[mysterious music]
[doors rumbling]

463
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:11,338
[door creaking]

464
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,341
[man] This place was
designed to keep dragons in,

465
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,510
not to take them out.

466
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,513
[Diao] My dear captain,
as far as I know,

467
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:21,949
there are no left-handed
people left in the empire.

468
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:25,886
So this brave little girl here

469
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,489
will give us a hand, won't you?

470
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:30,624
S-sir?

471
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,997
You will convince
Long Danzi to come with us

472
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,866
to help the Emperor.

473
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,701
Long Danzi?

474
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:45,372
The strongest and
last of all Imperial dragons.

475
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:50,678
He has one final service
to render for his majesty.

476
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:56,250
The Emperor
has need of his blood!

477
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:59,487
[Danzi roaring]

478
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:04,325
[Ping breathing heavily]

479
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,828
[Diao chuckles]

480
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,697
Calm down.

481
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:13,267
It was merely
a simple experiment.

482
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,872
You see, Captain?

483
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:22,076
Now, I'm sure Long Danzi
will cooperate tomorrow.

484
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,548
Dragons are strangely
attached to their Dragonkeepers.

485
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,651
He won't let her die,
even if it means his own life.

486
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:33,487
[Diao laughs]

487
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,656
Foolish creature.

488
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,959
[tense dramatic music]

489
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,130

[music continues]
[footsteps thudding]

495
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:09,223
[Diao] Oh, here he comes, girl.

496
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,959
How exciting.

497
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:15,162
[footsteps thumping]
[Danzi growls]

498
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,464

[soldiers grunting]

500
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:26,941
[chuckles] I think our friend
needs a little encouragement.

-Well done. Well done.
-[Ping groaning]

504
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:35,382
I believe we have his attention.

505
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:38,786
-[Hua Hua squeaking]
-[Diao gasps] Oh, how sweet.

506
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,056
Even the vermin
comes out to protect you.

507
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:43,658
[Hua Hua whimpers]
[Diao chuckles]

508
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:47,261
Nobody wants to see you suffer.

509
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,262
No!

510
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,931
-Honored Guest!
-[growling]

511
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,299
Heave!

512
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,003
No, no!

513
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:58,005
-Lift the gate!
-[roaring]

514
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,840
Don't go in the cage!

515
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:02,910
[dramatic music]
[Diao] That's it.

516
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,111
Lovely.

517
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:07,214
-[Ping grunting]
-[Diao] Nearly there.

518
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,550
One more.

Honored Guest!

527
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:36,745
-I've got a clear shot, sir.
-[man] Wait.

What? What are
you doing, Captain?

Go after the dragon.

The dragon is gone.

625

If you please, Master Diao,

I should carry
it for safekeeping.

You are very well informed
for someone so young, Captain.

Of course. [laughs]

I'm a servant.

662
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,365
It's my destiny.

Okay, so if I am free,

666
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,243
I can do what I want

667
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,613

Why me? You're a big dragon.

You can do it alone.

Okay, so you're listening.

695
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:47,929
What is this qi thing?
Why do I have it?

696
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:50,832
What does that have to do

[Danzi] <i>Yes you are.</i>

-More or less.
<i>-Ooh!</i>

792
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,994

[Danzi] <i>Hold on tight!</i>

823
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,267
[Emperor] You've been of
great service, Master Diao.

824
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,003
You shall be amply rewarded.

825
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:39,907
My reward is to serve,
Your Majesty.

826
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,876
In fact, there is
a further service

827
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,847
I may be allowed
to render, Your Majesty.

828
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:50,451
The ancient scrolls
speak of the secrets

829
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:55,089
of immortality being hidden
in the Pearl of Longevity.

830
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:59,260
If Your Majesty
would allow me to perform--

831
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,764
What do you think
about that, son?

832
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:06,333
You'd like to pore over
the ancient scrolls too,

833
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:07,301
wouldn't you?

834
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,902
The scroll said that immortality

835
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:12,139
is the gods' reward
for a virtuous life,

836
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:15,943
but to seek it for oneself
is to defy the gods.

837
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:18,713
So there you have it,
Master Diao.

838
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:21,549
We should not anger the gods.

839
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:26,053
Please forgive my foolishness,
Your Majesty.

840
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,055
I only wish that--

841
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,592
Master Diao, you look tired,

842
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:32,826
you deserve some rest.

843
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,261
Write some poetry

844
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:39,099
or go back to your little
insects and butterflies.

845
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,137
Thank you, Your Majesty.

846
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:45,072
Thank you.

848
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,612
Poetry, butterflies.

849
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,946
Of course, Your Majesty.

850
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,751
Always at your service,
Your Majesty.

851
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:01,288
Oh! I can't stand this anymore.

852
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:05,527
Soon I will show Your Majesty

853
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,096
the true face of
a god among men.

854
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,100
-[low rumbling]
-Oh yes, Your Majesty.

855
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:15,169
Soon you will pay.

856
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,708
Soon. [chuckles]

[hammer clanging]

864
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,253
Oh, welcome back, Master!

865
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,322
I--Whoa!

866
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,594
Oh! I do hope that you had
a pleasant trip! [chuckling]

867
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,495
Whoa! Ow! Ooh!

868
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,464
Not like the one
I just had. [chuckles]

869
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,633
Any delays?

870
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:21,368
How was the, uh, the weather?
[grunts]

871
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,204
Is it ready?

872
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:27,040
Yes, it's ready, Master.

[Wang Chao groaning]

[body thuds]

875
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:35,115
But are you sure
this is wise, Master?

876
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,951
How dare you question me!

877
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:40,921
If it weren't for me,
you'd be in jail or dead!

878
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:42,657
Or a mixture of both.

879
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,493
Sorry! Yeah, yeah. Good point.
Yeah, it's ready.

880
00:48:46,628 --> 00:48:48,630
[stammering]
And it's wise and good.

881
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,297
Oh, finally.

882
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,635
Finally my time draws near.

883
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:58,573
Soon I will join the gods!
[laughs]

884
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,910
I just need to get the pearl.

885
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:02,877
The pearl?

886

-[mysterious music]
-Uh...

887
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:08,081
Oh! No. Oh, I know.

Yes, yes, yes, yes! [laughs]

[Wang Chao shouts]

890
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,889
I'll poison the water
in the palace! [laughs]

[Wang Chao shouts]

892
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:16,758
Oh no.

[Wang Chao sighs]

894
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,092
No, that won't work.

[Diao] Oh, ha ha! I know.

899
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,236
I'll create a monkey spider

900
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:33,173
and train it to
steal the pearl, that-

901

-[Diao groans]
-[vases shatter]

902

No, that will take too long!

903

I haven't got time for that.

904
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,682
How can I get the...

Wang Chao!

906
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:46,487
Yes, Master?

907
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:49,423
Is there something
you would like to tell me?

908
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,291
Um, no, uh, nothing.

909
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:52,459
Can't--can't think of anything.

910
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:55,329
[laughs] Really?

911
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,500
I'm hearing them again.

912
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:00,902
[Diao] Hmm.

913
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:04,672
Well, my old friend.

914
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:08,743
This is what
you're going to do.

915
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:12,045
[Danzi] <i>There it is, Chang'an.</i>

916
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,382
<i>It is extremely well guarded.</i>

917
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:17,819
-We need a plan.
-[Danzi] <i>Yes.</i>

918
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,588
<i>You must always</i>
<i>look before you leap.</i>

919
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:22,790
-But--
-[Danzi] <i>Hang on!</i>

920
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:24,926
[Ping] Thanks for the--whoa!

921
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,460
[Ping shouting]

922
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:28,630
[dramatic music]

923
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:42,944
[Ping coughing]

924
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,016
You should... [coughs]

925
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:50,618
-say something!
-[Danzi chuckles]

926
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:52,987
<i>You must always be alert, Ping.</i>

927
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,124
[Ping]
Oh! Stop being so dragon.

928
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,294
I'm not laughing about it.

929
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,530
You are always
doing whatever you want.

930
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:05,198
-[Danzi chuckles]
-Great, great.

931
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:06,634
Now I'm soaking.

932
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:08,670
[Danzi roars]

933
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:11,739
Nice. Very nice.

934
00:51:11,873 --> 00:51:12,740
Thank you.

935
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,242
[Danzi]
<i>You're welcome.</i> [laughs]

936
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,244
[Ping groans] Danzi!

937
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:20,280
[Danzi roars]

938
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:23,383
[sighs] I can't
stand this anymore.

939
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,218
[mysterious music]

940
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,055
What is this place?

941
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:30,190
[Danzi]
<i>Wu Ching. A very old place.</i>

942
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:31,960
<i>It holds the memories of a war</i>

943
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:35,462
<i>that happened</i>
<i>a long, long time ago.</i>

944
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,765
[Hua Hua squeaking]

945
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,701
[Ping] A war?

946
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,969
Really?

947
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:44,038
Who are they?

948
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,542
[Danzi] <i>Well, the humans called</i>
<i>them the Necromancers.</i>

949
00:51:47,675 --> 00:51:49,677
<i>They caused great suffering</i>

950
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:52,847
<i>and it took us great suffering</i>
<i>to defeat them.</i>

951
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:54,882
And this is you?

952
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,517
[Danzi] <i>He was our king.</i>

953
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,086
<i>He was mortally wounded.</i>

954
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:02,557
<i>But we flew him across the</i>
<i>ocean to the waters of life.</i>

955
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,526
<i>They can heal all wounds.</i>

956
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,260
<i>It was during this war</i>

957
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:11,633
<i>that humans and dragons</i>
<i>first fought side by side.</i>

958
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:15,737
But then why did
they put you in cages?

959
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:19,073
[Danzi sighs]

960
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:30,785
What? What is it?

961
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:33,921
[Danzi] <i>The entrance to</i>
<i>Wu Ching is sealed.</i>

962
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:37,491
<i>Its tunnels run deep</i>
<i>under the Imperial palace.</i>

963
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,926
<i>We would have to break</i>
<i>the seal--</i>

964
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,863
No, no, no! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

965
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:43,598
Ping, get behind me.

966
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,002
Long Danzi,
you don't recognize me?

967
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,805
-[Danzi] <i>What?</i>
-Lu Yu's Dragonkeeper

968
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,472
-from way back when.
-[Ping gasps]

969
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,008
A Dragonkeeper.

970
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,544
[Danzi] <i>Wang Chao?</i>

971
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:58,780
[Danzi chuckles]

972
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:01,415
Oh, you must be Ping.

973
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:05,053
You can't go through
the Imperial seal, Danzi.

974
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,888
It's too dangerous.

975
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:09,757
A dragon full of qi in Wu Ching?

976
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:12,492
I mean, I can't even
begin to think what will happen.

977
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:15,596
And it, it's forbidden.
[chuckles]

978
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,266
Oh, Old Wang
knows a way to get in there.

979
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:21,501
-Ha ha!
-[Danzi] <i>Ah.</i>

980
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:23,905
[mysterious music]

981
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:26,541
[Wang Chao humming]

982
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:37,118
Ta-da! [chuckles]

983
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:41,656
[sighs] Only for small people.
Only for Wang.

984
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,759
Maybe a little girl.

985
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:48,462
Oh! Oh, look at that!

986
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:50,765
Ha! Fortune favors us.
[chuckles]

987
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,967
[Danzi] <i>She can't go</i>
<i>alone into the palace.</i>

988
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:54,802
<i>She's just a little girl.</i>

989
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:56,804
I'm not just a little girl.

990
00:53:56,938 --> 00:54:00,474
You must trust in Lu Yu.
She chose Ping.

991
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,044
[growls softly]

992
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:06,279
He will not hesitate
to attack us.

993
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:11,119
They are very
dangerous animals.

994
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:13,253
-[coughs]
-Father,

995
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:15,590
the pearl is losing color.

996
00:54:16,224 --> 00:54:18,059
How long is it going to last?

997
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:21,529
Until it is of no
use to me. [coughs]

998
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,600
Your Majesty.

999
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:30,538
[emperor continues coughing]
[tense music]

1000
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:36,911
[Wang Chao] Ta-da!

1001
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:40,114
Wu Ching, the Forgotten City.

1002
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:48,089
Mmm. What you did
before with that boulder,

1003
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:52,093
with your hands,
with your face so focused.

1004
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:54,195
It was awesome!

1005
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:58,132
[laughs] Yeah,
it was, wasn't it?

1006
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:03,204
But I can't control my qi.

1007
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,140
Maybe you...

1008
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:10,511
Maybe I could
teach you a trick or two?

1009
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,512
You would?

1010
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,714
Hmm, yeah.

1011
00:55:14,215 --> 00:55:16,984
But this is going
to be very dangerous.

1012
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:19,887
This city is
very sensitive to qi.

1013
00:55:20,188 --> 00:55:24,091
And we can awaken old spirits
if too much is released.

1014
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:27,028
Let's see if you can invite

1015
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:30,164
these fireflies
into this basket.

1016
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:31,165
Start with that one.

1017
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:32,900
[Ping] This is gonna be so fun.

1018
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:36,804
But...but h-how do I use it?

1019
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,741
Don't try to use your qi.

1020
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,343
Let it flow through you.

1021
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:46,681
The qi is the wind.
You are the sail.

1022
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:49,050
Too little qi,
and the ship won't move.

1023
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,319
Too much and it will sink.

1024
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:54,487
I could move that rock.

1025
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:58,526
Not because I'm powerful, but
because I was able to feel it.

1026
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,963
So should I feel
about the fireflies?

1027
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:04,265
[Wang Chao]
You should, you must.

1028
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:06,534
You must feel
everything around you.

1029
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:07,935
[Ping gasps]

1030
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:09,237
Thank you, Wang Chao.

1031
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,571
Thank you.

1032
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:13,373
It's a pity we didn't
find you sooner, you know?

1033
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:14,942
Because you're
such a great teacher.

1034
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,244
We're lucky to have you

1035
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:19,247
and I'm sure
that everything will be fine.

1036
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:20,281
Ping, I...

1037
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:28,289
Breathe, Ping. [inhales]

1038
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:30,825
Fill your lungs with compassion.

1039
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,425
Hey? Hmm?

1040
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,930
That will allow you
to feel the firefly.

1041
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:37,865
Hmm.

1042
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:42,303
-[mysterious music]
-There, good. Yeah.

1043
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,305
Be careful!

1044
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:46,507
[Wang Chao gasps]

1045
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:49,010
[Ping] What is it?

1046
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:50,578
Oh, those...

1047
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,680
those--those are
the Necromancers.

1048
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,849
Shh, don't wake them!

1049
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:57,084
They are dead?

1050
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,586
Dead, asleep.

1051
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,122
Doesn't matter.
Always dangerous.

1052
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,624
We have to hurry! Come on.

1053
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:08,996
We must be in position
before Danzi gets here.

1054
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:13,200
Let's try to fill
a basket on the way.

1055
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:14,635
Whoa!

1056
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:16,671
Whoa, steady.

1057
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,709
If I learn how
to control the qi,

1058
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,946
it means I'm a Dragonkeeper!

1059
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,283
[Wang Chao laughs]
Ah, so young.

1060
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,552
Yeah, Dragonkeeper. Good.

1061
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:33,554
[crickets chirping]

1062
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:36,390
[tense music]

1063
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,173
[suspenseful music]

1064
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,342
Dragon attack! Dragon attack!

1065
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:57,278
-[soldier] Dragon attack!
-[soldier 2] Dragon attack!

1066
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:59,747
-[drums pounding]
-[soldier 3] Dragon attack!

1067
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,919
[dramatic music]
[soldiers shouting indistinctly]

1068
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,458
Wait until he's in range!

1069
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:13,928
Get ready!

1070
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,964
[music continues]

1071
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:25,906
[soldiers shouting]

1072
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,010
[water crashing]

1073
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:33,948
[soldier] Wait for it!

1074
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:34,882
Now!

1075
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:36,984
[Danzi roars]

1076
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,053
[drums pounding]

1077
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:43,457
-Remember the plan?
-Yes, Teacher.

1078
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:44,859
Be careful.

1079
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,694
[dramatic music]

1080
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,904
[guards gasping]

1081

But you don't
have a choice, Old Wang.

1084
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:19,528
Not now.
Master Diao, he did save you.

1085
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,330
And he can turn you
into a legless centipede.

It's not safe, Your Highness.

1095
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,881
You'll serve your majesty better
by following his commands.

1096
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,217
But I always obey his commands,

1097
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,385
yet he never
lets me do anything!

1098
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,621
This is not fair! Why?

1099
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:23,891
I have to obey everything

The dragon's broken through.
It's getting closer.

Your Majesty, we must
move you to a safer location.

Is the Imperial throne
not safe for the son of heaven?

1105
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:49,016
Get out there
and stop the dragon.

You should be

What you did to
