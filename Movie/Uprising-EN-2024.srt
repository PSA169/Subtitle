3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,990
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORICAL EVENTS

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
The Joseon Dynasty scholar Jeong Yeo-rip

5
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
asserted that all people are equal
and should have no master.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,300
In a private community he formed
called Great Unity,

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,387
noblemen and slaves shared food and drink
and practiced martial arts together.

8
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,266
Accused of treason
and besieged by the king's army,

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,019
Jeong Yeo-rip took his own life
by plunging a sword into his neck.

10
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,938
This was under the reign of King Seonjo.

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,292
Get the captives ready!

12
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
I say all kings

13
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,091
and all slaves

14
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,552
are born equal.

15
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,017
"Are born equal?"

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,481
SEONJEONGJEON HALL

17
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,832
Is this a message from your father?

18
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,293
Answer me now.

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,296
How can he answer with his tongue cut out?

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,967
- Quiet.
- I believe he had much to say.

21
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,636
"The world belongs to all."

22
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,432
"Whoever wants the throne may take it."

23
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,519
Councilor!

24
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,230
"Kings and slaves are equals, you see."

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,190
Is that how things are?

26
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,900
My liege!

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,113
Do not sully your royal lips
with the words of that traitor!

28
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,866
Butchers, whores, slaves,
all of them could…

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,493
could occupy the throne if that's true.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,835
Sit down if you want.

31
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,131
Ah, the <i>gonryongpo.</i>

32
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,884
- Of course, how could I forget?
- Your Majesty.

33
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,054
Your Majesty!
I beg you, Your Majesty!

34
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,056
We beg you, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,436
How could such a horrible thing happen?!

36
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,276
Judge! What are you waiting for?

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,197
Cut the heads off the disgusting traitors
and hang them high!

38
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,619
OK-NAM, SON OF REBEL LEADER JEONG YEO-RIP

39
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,963
Gather round!

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,924
Here we go once more!

41
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,599
Did you see that?

42
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,434
You see that?

43
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,479
Let me try one more time.
One more time.

44
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,029
Oh, how horrible.

45
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,495
Runaway slave!
Make way! Runaway slave!

46
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,250
Look at this. This is what happens
when slaves try to run!

47
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,566
Hey, look. Up there. You see that?

48
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,945
Just like a certain someone,
he stepped out of line,

49
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,155
and look how that ended, huh?

50
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,373
Bastard!

51
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,008
What's happening here?

52
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,678
Such insolence!

53
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,930
Inspector-General Yi Deok-hyeong is here!

54
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,348
Show some respect!

55
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,274
- Let go of me!
- Hey, keep still!

56
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,152
In such close proximity
to our royal highness…

57
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,696
- Let go of me!
- …must you really raise such a fuss?

58
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,698
Please forgive me for my impudence,
my lord.

59
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,701
I'm a slave hunter. My name is Gwang-yi.

60
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,456
So far, I've managed
to capture this many slaves.

61
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,042
He's made a run for it twice now.

62
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,461
He's rotten to the core.

63
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,962
RUNAWAY SLAVE

64
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,133
And this time, he even stole
something priceless from his master.

65
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,137
This is our master's sword.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,437
YI JONG-RYEO
BEST IN MILITARY ARTS

67
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,235
His mother was a slave
of the Deputy Minister of Defense.

68
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,445
12 YEARS AGO

69
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,408
JANGYEWON: SLAVE REGISTRY OFFICE

70
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,659
Like one, like all.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,620
Do you know what this means?

72
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,622
I believe it means

73
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:17,085
a child with a slave parent
is consigned to a life of slavery as well.

74
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,462
That's the law, I'm afraid. Case closed.

75
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,173
But my wife and I were both born
as common folk.

76
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,592
She was sold off
so our debt could be paid,

77
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,554
but… my son was conceived
before any of that happened.

78
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,973
But is a child not
part of a mother's body?

79
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,561
When the mother becomes a slave,
then so does the child inside.

80
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,355
That can only be right.

81
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,484
He was raised free,
and now suddenly he's a slave?

82
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,535
Give me that.

83
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,204
- Look, you little…
- Ah! No! Don't!

84
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,416
My father made that for me!

85
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,919
You disobedient…

86
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm going to teach you the history
of the family you'll be serving,

87
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,635
so clean out your ears and listen.

88
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,346
I really don't care.

89
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,058

<i>"Noh" means male slave.</i>
<i>"Bi" means female slave.</i>

97
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,127

<i>He's going to be a general.</i>
<i>He can't be covered in scars.</i>

116
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,324
How does that make sense?

117
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,493
- What's this now?
- Why would I get hit?

118
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,954
- I didn't do anything.
- Shut up, will you?

119
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,705
You talk too much for a little brat.

120
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,083
Ah! We are back, Master.

121
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,547
Bow your head, now!

122
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,177
- Do you even realize where…
- Hmm?

123
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,763
You rascal!

124
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,977
Come here!

125
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,359
- You little shit!
- Enough of this!

126
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,493
Get rid of it!

127
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,542
My baby!

128
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,794
He's got strong bones.

129
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,589
Healthy as an ox. Look at these teeth.

130
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,674
See? All of them are there.

131
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,681
This is the new boy?

132
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,435
I'm curious how long this one will last.

133
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,706
How can I go on after this?

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,793
How could this happen?

135
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:32,048
It's my fault, darling.
It's my fault you were born a slave.

136
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,968
Oh God, it's all my fault!

137
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,430
It's inhuman.
How many times has this happened now?

138
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,391
Let's… Let's cover him up now.

139
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,216
Your name is Cheon-yeong?

140
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,053
What does your name mean?

141
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,557
I guess you don't know.

142
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,144
This "Cheon" means "to follow,"

143
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,730
and this "Yeong" means "shadow."

144
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,526
You'll follow me like a shadow.

145
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,361
What do you say?

146
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,449
Ah!

147
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,620
You still have
your baby teeth.

148
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,874
You think I'll be your shadow?

149
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,923
What are you doing?

150
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,762
Huh?

151
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,806
Wait!

152
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,811
I'm back!

153
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,898
Father?

154
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,489
Huh?

155
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,476
Oh shit.

156
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,605
Go away! I said go away!

157
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,402
- Cut it out.
- Father!

158
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,782
- Father!
- Ooh, you're a loud one.

159
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,452
Keep walking.

160
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,419
Isn't that Cheon-yeong?
Goodness, how many years has it been?

161
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,312
You really can't let go, can you?

162
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
Each time I manage to get out,

163
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,985
you drag me right on back.

164
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,612
Just be quiet, will you?

165
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,991
Look how far you've come.

166
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,161
Our young master
who failed the exam every year,

167
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,665
and then, after some miracle, you…

168
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,835
you end up placing first in the nation.

169
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,170
- What does that even mean?
- What'd he say?

170
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,646
Do it.

171
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,487
The servants are watching, Father.

172
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,573
You cannot take his life. Please.

173
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,548
Worthless degenerate.
Lock him in the shed!

174
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,238
Just kill me!

175
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,327
Unless you want your whole family
to die slowly by my hands, Master.

176
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,330
Your father.

177
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,540
Your mother.

178
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,876
Your wife!

179
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,671
Your child.

180
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,467
I'll throw every one of you
into a raging fire

181
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,844
{\an8}and watch as you die!

182
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,816
Hold him down.

183
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,749
There's nothing I can do for you anymore.

184
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,359
- Your head's exposed.
- <i>He goes high.</i>

185
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,905
<i>Then left, jab,</i>
<i>down to the right, up to the left…</i>

186
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,959
Ah.

187
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,129
Look,
for each time I get hit during the day,

188
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,964
you get hit twice at night.

189
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,800
Get in position.

190
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,885
Your teacher's moves are predictable.

191
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,264
If he starts high up,
he always falls to the right

192
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,890
and then like this.

193
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,436
- If he starts from here--
- The shoulders. He'll jab first.

194
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,438
So you know.

195
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,442
Let's practice, then.

196
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,422
You have to duck under it.

197
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,550
Uh-uh. The other foot.

198
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,597
- Like this?
- Yeah, good work.

199
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,603
Starting tomorrow,
I have to train with you.

200
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,531
Does that mean
he won't hit me anymore, you think?

201
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,367
Uh-huh. I think so.

202
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,786
Strike!

203
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,882
This won't work at the exam, you know.

204
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
You have to put in some anger.

205
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,345
You don't need to worry.

206
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,515
Once I meet a real foe,

207
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,769
this sword will… hold plenty of anger.

208
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,196
MILITARY EXAMINATION OFFICE

209
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,822
- Park Tae-ju.
- Here.

210
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,866
- Kim Yi-nam.
- Here.

211
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,451
Yi Jong-ryeo.

212
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,579
- Wish me luck.
- Yi Jong-ryeo.

213
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,375
Go!

214
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,759
How many failures does this mark?

215
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,012
You shame not only me
but this whole house!

216
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,309
When I die, how will I face my ancestors?

217
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,480
Wait!

218
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,236
Please allow me
to take the exam on Young Master's behalf.

219
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,030
Are you out of your mind?

220
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,909
My only request is that you
promise to liberate me.

221
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,704
Then I shall pass with top marks
and bring home the royal flowers.

222
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,293
- Yi Jong-ryeo.
- I am Yi Jong-ryeo.

223
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,212
- Kim Min-seok.
- Here.

224
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,422
- Yi Jong-won.
- Here.

225
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,614
Why, Our Majesty even gave him
a <i>cheongchonik.</i>

226
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,702
The royal flowers suit you well,
I have to say.

227
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,495
Not even I placed first.

228
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,955
Can you believe it?

229
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,833
Cheon-yeong.

230
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,880
Look at you.

231
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,341
You were born to wear a <i>cheongchonik.</i>

232
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,396
Wait here.

233
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,692
I'll get your slave papers from Father.
Have a drink in the meantime.

234
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,615
I was told
not to give him a drop of water.

235
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,410
Anyone who disobeys orders
will end up like this.

236
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,536
Get out!

237
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,122
Back to work!

238
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,485
Father, take a look at that bird.

239
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,612
It looks like it's floating.

240
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,615
What in the world is… That looks like…

241
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,200
Oh!

242
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,418
WAR

243
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,797
- Young Master.
- Steward Kim.

244
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,715
- Is Mother still awake?
- Yes.

245
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,551
You say the king will flee the capital?

246
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,763
I, too, must leave now
to escort His Majesty.

247
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,807
I sent a messenger to Uncle in Wonsan.

248
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,684
You must leave quietly
once Father gets back here.

249
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,278
Please take good care of him.

250
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,370
My sword is missing.

251
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,248
I shall find it
and send it to you at once.

252
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,209
So worry not and make haste, Young Master.

253
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
The key.

254
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,569
Come on.

255
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,905
How could they already be at Yongin
when Busan Fortress just fell?

256
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,157
Makes no sense to me.

257
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,951
They blew through
General Shin's great army.

258
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,538
A complete disaster.
Why else would we get ready to flee?

259
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,126
Fucking hell.
Sounds like it's no ordinary war.

260
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,712
Oh…

261
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,089
I know you're a lowborn thief,
but still, there are limits.

262
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,258
You dare steal a gift from His Majesty?

263
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,260
Hand it over right now!

264
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,638
- I don't know what you mean!
- How dare you play dumb with me!

265
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,641
- Where's the blade, huh?
- I don't know! I have no idea!

266
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,603
- Give me the damn blade!
- He told you he doesn't know!

267
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,159
You. You dare?!

268
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:58,914
Everyone take arms.
How long must we be treated like pigs?

269
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,464
Put those down this instant.
What do you think you're doing?

270
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,682
Where are the papers, huh?

271
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,190
You're home awfully late
tonight, my lord.

272
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,541
Look at this. You see this right here?

273
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,709
This means we're equals now.

274
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,183
Now, now, hurry!

275
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,093
Young Master.

276
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,012
No.

277
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,972
No.

278
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,971
The young master, where'd he go?

279
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,688
- Where's your husband?
- Keep away! Stay away from me!

280
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,067
This is your curse, you brute!

281
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,780
This is dangerous. My lady, don't…

282
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,865
No, don't head that…

283
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,039
You dare touch me with those filthy hands!

284
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,627
Are you insane?

285
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,672
Get out of there!

286
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,541
Now even the lanterns fail us.
Come on!

287
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,461
Everyone, carefully now.

288
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,670
Go slowly.

289
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,130
Oh!

290
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,508
Oh no, Your Highness,
are you all right?

291
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,261
- Forgive me.
- Must I lie here in the rain?

292
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,180
Your Highness!

293
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,515
Well, what did she expect
if she wouldn't ride a horse?

294
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,809
Are you all right,
Your Highness?

295
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,103
Oh?

296
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,233
What are you staring at, hmm?
What are you all…

297
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,494
- How could they have reached here already?
- It's impossible.

298
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,121
The Japanese couldn't have
crossed the Han River yet.

299
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,874
Then what am I looking at?

300
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,251
- That is the palace, is it not?
- Yes, sire.

301
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,711
Oh.

302
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,007
I demand to know who would dare
to set the Royal Palace on fire.

303
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,802
Your Majesty, shamefully, I must report

304
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,846
that the people of the city have…

305
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,015
My people did this?

306
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,603
Why would they?

307
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,238
What kind of king deserts
his people and runs?

308
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,291
Give me those goddamn papers!

309
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,045
You fools!
You think this is gonna change anything?

310
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,019
{\an8}TRAITOR JEONG YEO-RIP

311
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,452
Look at it burn! Burn it all down!

312
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,957
- How could this happen?
- Father, no!

313
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,680
Serves them right!

314
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,062
I thought all the officers
had fled the capital.

315
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,540
The capital, finally.

316
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,168
Forward.

317
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,462
- Forward!
- Yes, sir!

318
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,305
Come!

319
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,514
WEAPONS MANUFACTURING OFFICE

320
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,099
Everybody gather round now!

321
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,477
I hear the Japanese
have crossed the river.

322
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,397
It's just a matter of time now.
Even the king himself has forsaken us.

323
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,441
It's on us to do what we can
to fight back.

324
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,776
We're dying out here.

325
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,904
- Do you have some sort of plan in mind?
- What can we do?

326
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,699
Over here!
Look, I brought you a military officer.

327
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,285
- Oh, it's Sam-mun!
- Who's that next to him?

328
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,830
Is that really an officer?
He looks so shabby.

329
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,249
Look at that sword and robe.
You can tell right away.

330
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,417
Right, right.

331
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,843
Spears, swords, bows!
Can any of you wield these?

332
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,392
Out of all the men here,
is this really it?

333
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,437
All who serve will be rewarded.
Even slaves.

334
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,855
Yes, all of you.

335
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,442
Liberty! Buy yourselves out of slavery.

336
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,406
Do not hesitate because
of your lowborn status. Step forward.

337
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,369
- Anybody. Come on.
- When it comes to slings, I'm unbeatable.

338
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,122
You won't find a better shot.
How about it?

339
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,499
No, no, no, no! Have you lost your mind?

340
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,960
- Are you trying to get killed?
- You said swords.

341
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,587
How about a meat cleaver?
Does that work for ya?

342
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,674
Mr. Butcher, it sure does.

343
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,385
Never in my wildest dreams

344
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,804
could I have imagined
being addressed as "mister."

345
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,307
- Then I'm in too!
- Stop it, you fool!

346
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,475
Come forward, then.

347
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,978
We should see if there are weapons
left over in the armory.

348
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,941
Yeah, come on, let's go! Let's go.

349
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,584
I lack energy. I need to eat.

350
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,213
Quickly, bring a platter.

351
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,841
- Ready the boat.
- Mind your posture.

352
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,928
- Post guards to keep watch.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,228
Don't let a single one live.

354
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,861
Burn it all down!

355
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,951
You dare, you dog?

356
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,454
- Let go!
- Stay still, shaman wench.

357
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,457
Do you not fear
the wrath of heaven?!

358
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,085
What is this, then?

359
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,004
You bastard! I see it.

360
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,258
The blade you carry now
will find itself lodged in your throat.

361
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,052
What did she say?

362
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,722
She said your sword
will end up piercing your throat.

363
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,602
I will pierce my own throat?

364
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,438
I'll remember that.

365
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,029
How will it happen?
Like this?

366
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,665
This is all you bring?

367
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,464
I've never laid my eyes on such fish.

368
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,550
Forgive us, my lord.

369
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,595
We combed through every home in the area,
but this is all we could find.

370
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,349
- What was that?
- Right there.

371
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,184
- Look, there he is!
- Over there, over there!

372
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,769
What the hell is this?

373
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,438
He's right there. Get him!

374
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,360
Bow your heads.

375
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,530
You've bled us dry for years,
and now you abandon us all to die?

376
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,616
We can't even honor our dead.
That fish was for memorial rites.

377
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,243
That was for our families!

378
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,120
- These insolent…
- Do you crave death?

379
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,665
- You dare block the royal path?
- We don't care if the path is royal!

380
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,626
The bastard's leaving us to die
while he rides to safety!

381
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,299
Get His Majesty to the boat!

382
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,842
Let go of me!

383
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,933
- Out of the way!
- You bastard!

384
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,692
Yi Jong-ryeo, what are you doing?

385
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,243
Out of the way!

386
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,831
What are you doing here?

387
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,042
I regret to inform you, sir,

388
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,880
your slaves took up torches
and burned your manor to the ground.

389
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,089
What do you mean?

390
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,467
What do you mean by that?

391
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,096
Where's my family?

392
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,684
Are they all right?

393
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,397
It was already too late when I arrived.

394
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,108
I fear the fire had already taken them.

395
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:22,323
And… my son too?

396
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,577
Hey, you sons of bitches!

397
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,830
One more thing.

398
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,876
Cheon-yeong was fleeing the manor,
and he stole your horse.

399
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,544
He was wearing your blue robe.

400
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,246
I want Cheon-yeong brought to me
immediately.

401
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,299
Kill them all!

402
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,261
Are you all right, sir?
Where did that come from?

403
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,972
Bullseye!

404
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,557
Is he alone?

405
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,475
What's that clown
think he's doing?

406
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,727
Whoo!

407
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,521
You son of a…

408
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,275
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

409
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,236
- You bastards!
- This way, you dirty rats!

410
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,696
Get over here!

411
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,407
Shields, forward!

412
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,124
- Get away!
- Chase them!

413
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,420
Not yet. Not yet!

414
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,506
Hold formation! Hold formation!

415
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,552
Fire! Forward!

416
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,304
How reckless.

417
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,891
Some <i>nigirimeshi</i>, sir.

418
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,482
Keep pushing. Don't fall back!

419
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,695
Second line, forward!

420
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,992
Reload!

421
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,329
Hit them
when they're reloading.

422
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,290
- Get ready.
- Huh?

423
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,209
Right, right, right.

424
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,293
Fire!

425
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,541
Aoki.

426
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,545
Break through the right side
with the cavalrymen.

427
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,297
Yes, sir.

428
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,306
Royal Guard Commander,
protect His Majesty!

429
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,162
Damn you!

430
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,430
- Honda.
- Sir!

431
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,690
Your Majesty!

432
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,943
There's no time for that.

433
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,737
Hurry! Hurry! Set sail now!

434
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,037
That's right! That's right.

435
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,707
Launch the boat! Now!

436
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,753
Sir, please, let us live!

437
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,736
Show yourself.

438
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,241
Stand down.

439
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:06,125
I am Genshin Kikkawa,
Konishi Battalion's frontline commander.

440
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
State your rank and name.

441
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,006
This is Konishi Battalion's
frontline commander, Kikkawa Genshin.

442
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,173
State your rank and name.

443
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,342
Well, my rank is dog.

444
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,469
- His rank is dog.
- My name…

445
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,180
- And his name is…
- I answer to Bastard.

446
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,682
It's Bastard.

447
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,361
"Yi Jong-ryeo"?

448
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,105
You are quite skilled
for a Joseon swordsman.

449
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,650
A skilled swordsman
is a rarity in Joseon.

450
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,071
Well, you're not so bad yourself, are you?

451
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,822
You are quite skilled.

452
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,243
- Losing strength already?
- Tired already?

453
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,621
I just haven't eaten all day is all.

454
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,915
How about you give me one
of those rice balls first?

455
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,876
He says he's hungry.
He wants some rice balls.

456
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,980
Are you unharmed?

457
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:38,861
Once I get off this boat…
destroy the dock.

458
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,449
But, sire, if we destroy the dock,
the people will have no means of refuge.

459
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,909
This boat too. Sink it as well.

460
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,747
Don't leave anything the enemy
could use for rafts, understand?

461
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,959
Set fire to all the homes.

462
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,253
Burn everything down.

463
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:12,936
STRUGGLE

464
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,405
7 YEARS LATER

465
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,917
Hey, give it here!

466
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,878
Hogging all the food for yourself?
I want some too!

467
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,047
No, it's mine! Mine!

468
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,966
- What's this? Is it food?
- It's a corpse. A dead body.

469
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,219
Leave us a leg at least, please?

470
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,064
It is I, Gwang-yi.

471
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,656
I found two this time.

472
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,702
Cheon-yeong's still missing.

473
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,456
I will keep searching, sir.

474
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:36,728
SUNCHEON BASE CAMP OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARMY
(VOLUNTEER MILITIA)

475
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,276
Please.
I'm sorry I couldn't have done more.

476
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,736
General Kim, I wish you
good health and longevity.

477
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,365
That's… Raise your heads.
That's… that's enough.

478
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,326
Thanks to you, General,
we can go home safely.

479
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,079
- I owe it all to you, friends.
- No, not at all.

480
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,499
Hey, Beom-dong,
why the long face?

481
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,796
Do you really think it's a good idea
to let 'em go home like this?

482
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,967
They say some Japanese rats are
still roaming around disguised as locals.

483
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,929
I think everyone's tired.
We've been fighting for years now.

484
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,473
It's time to move on, isn't it?

485
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,644
<i>♪ Hurrah, how exciting ♪</i>

486
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,355
<i>♪ Just live and let live</i>
<i>Just live and let live… </i>♪

487
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,732
Here.

488
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,692
They all get to go home now,

489
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,653
but we have to stay behind
and clean up the mess. Is that it?

490
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,698
- Ugh.
- Oh! Look who it is!

491
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,784
Mr. Tactician!

492
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:36,330
I hope he brought some good news
this time around.

493
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,541
I appreciate
all your efforts.

494
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,085
- How long has it been?
- Too long.

495
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,720
You see, I had a dream last night,

496
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:56,391
and in it, the pond in the garden
looked three times bigger.

497
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:00,437
What a sight to behold.
Truly it was.

498
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,566
Eh, brush.

499
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,820
A pavilion.

500
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,408
I want to build a larger pavilion here,
like in the dream.

501
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,872
And, son, would you want to be
the one who names it?

502
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,540
Father, I'm not…

503
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,251
I do not understand
why we're rushing to rebuild.

504
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,545
Surely the palace can wait.

505
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,428
Look at this.
The character for "palace"

506
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,973
combines the characters
for "spine" and "roof."

507
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,433
Without the palace to represent
the strength of this country,

508
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,102
sovereign rule is just an idea.

509
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,812
This represents real power!

510
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,065
You think you can attain real power
through ideas alone?

511
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,114
- 600 rooms, you say?
- Sire.

512
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,741
600 is lacking, I think.

513
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,203
6,000 sounds a little more fitting, I say.

514
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,539
Quite right.

515
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,210
KING SEONJO'S TEMPORARY RESIDENCE

516
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,294
Uh…

517
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,634
Uh.

518
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:19,307
All of you sacrificed so much
for the crown during the war.

519
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,144
It's a pleasure to have you here today.

520
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,896
We are truly obliged, Your Majesty.

521
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,149
We are truly obliged.

522
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,942
Begin the feast, I say.

523
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,116
Wow!
Now <i>this </i>is a feast, isn't it?

524
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,369
All the corpses laying around
mean we get fat crows!

525
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,503
- It's cooked to perfection.
- Thank you.

526
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,880
I'm about to pass out.

527
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,760
All right, now, let's see here.

528
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,471
Ah… Ah…

529
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,973
That's not…

530
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,852
That's right.
Once a nobleman, always a nobleman.

531
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,854
Enough of all that. Just take a bite.

532
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,356
Or do you want me to come
and pick the meat for you?

533
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,316
Um…

534
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,444
You really had to put me on the spot.

535
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,283
How was that?

536
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,077
Eat up.

537
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,419
Goddamn, this is bad.

538
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,133
General, about how many Japanese
have we killed at this point?

539
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,094
What's going on?

540
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,179
Aren't they supposed
to allow us our freedom

541
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,431
for our contributions to the war effort?

542
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,018
Bastards couldn't keep their word
if their necks depended on it.

543
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,187
What's the explanation this go around?

544
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,107
"The royal court can't approve it
at this time."

545
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,068
"Your victories can't be verified
without proof."

546
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,528
They have many.

547
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,405
I plan
to visit Hanyang soon,

548
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,866
and I'll request an audience
with the king.

549
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,786
I understand how you all feel, but please,

550
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,206
just a little longer is all I ask.

551
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,626
General,
instead of wasting your time and energy

552
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,419
going all the way to see the king,

553
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,964
let's just settle down here.

554
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,094
I mean, we can build a village right here.

555
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:23,682
And build a community. All of us together.
How does that sound to you?

556
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,185
General, I heard you sold your mansion
and everything you had

557
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,937
to fight for your country.

558
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,773
We can build you an even bigger mansion.

559
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,360
We got a roofer right here.
And where's the carpenter?

560
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,779
- Right here!
- Look, there we go. We're all set!

561
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,032
So then, how many rooms are you thinking?

562
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,659
For your…

563
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,412
Did I not make myself clear, General?

564
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,373
One for us all.

565
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,127
Oh my goodness.

566
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,963
<i>It was your slave, you said?</i>

567
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,551
He was the one
who killed your entire family?

568
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,222
I treated him as an equal
and took care of him,

569
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,977
but he kept running away,
so then my family hired hunters.

570
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,981
He was dragged back one day,
and he swore to burn my family alive,

571
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,611
and that's how they died,
just the way he said.

572
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,154
Awful, awful.

573
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,949
However,

574
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:29,122
I can't exactly say
you are completely free from blame.

575
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,084
What compelled you
to treat a slave like an equal?

576
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,217
You know Jeong Yeo-rip, yes?

577
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,347
And his "Great Unity"
or whatever he called it.

578
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,226
It wasn't that, sire. I simply…

579
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:53,772
I know.

580
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,024
I understand.

581
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,694
But even if you grow fond of the lowborn,

582
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,781
you must learn to hide those feelings.

583
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,576
Favoritism tends to breed arrogance
in them.

584
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,455
Benevolence will beget chaos
within their kind.

585
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,667
Such is the harsh
and often terrible burden

586
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,043
of we who rule, you see.

587
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,047
Drink up.

588
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:26,179
I, too, experienced such an immense loss
during the war.

589
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,849
So how could I not sympathize?

590
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,103
Our people experienced untold horrors
during the war,

591
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,563
but nothing compares
to what you went through, sire.

592
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,733
We must restore the palace quickly
to ensure your safety.

593
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,152
- This is our priority.
- Oh.

594
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,530
Your Majesty.

595
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,950
The war wreaked havoc on our country
for seven years.

596
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:52,038
Our constituents are resorting to eating
the flesh off of their dead to survive.

597
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,375
How can such starved, ill people
handle the massive effort

598
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,377
of constructing an entire palace?

599
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,464
Not only that,
scores of citizens lost their noses

600
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,466
to the savagery of the Japanese.

601
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,512
That was due to
Toyotomi Hideyoshi's bounty, was it not?

602
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,515
It sounds like you blame me? And besides…

603
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,810
- You don't need a nose to lift.
- Your Majesty!

604
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,024
First, form an agency of recognition

605
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,985
to honor those who contributed
to our victory.

606
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,780
Then raise the lowborn status of those
who fought with everything they had.

607
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,701
This will win back the hearts
of the people, Your Majesty.

608
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,497
There's no need for tears.

609
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,964
Agency of recognition, very well.
Do as you will.

610
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,924
I never told you you couldn't, did I?

611
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:49,179
However, the palace restoration
cannot be delayed any further.

612
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,849
Establish a separate agency
for that as well.

613
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,143
Understood?

614
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,043
Head!

615
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,839
Hold on. One moment.

616
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,096
- Let go of me!
- What, you don't think I know your tricks?

617
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,236
Oh my!

618
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,240
Sh!

619
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,246
Sh, sh, sh, sh!

620
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,502
All right, then.

621
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,924
You must follow proper decorum.
You know this.

622
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,177
You're a noble.
You can't treat a lowborn as a friend.

623
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,640
I…

624
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,227
So I can show affection to a dog,

625
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,355
but it's not allowed with a lowborn?

626
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,152
A dog is raised,
while a slave is meant to be commanded.

627
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,363
Goodness.

628
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,157
Understood.

629
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,202
I shall go command my slave, then.

630
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,566
Let's hurry. Hurry.

631
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:14,115
- It's hot even at dawn.
- Shut up and keep walking.

632
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,244
General!

633
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,206
General! Japanese soldiers are here!

634
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,251
Beom-dong! Hyung-nim! Come quickly!

635
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,712
I'm telling you,
I saw Japanese invaders in disguise!

636
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,506
Here and here.

637
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,468
They're bound to reveal themselves
if we cut off their means of escape.

638
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,519
The king's palace, uh…

639
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,855
is it in that direction?

640
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,191
Isn't it over there?

641
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,361
The direction of the Rat.

642
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,738
RAT

643
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,867
Must we do this
every time we head to battle?

644
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,704
If anything, the king should be the one
doing the bowing.

645
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,509
General! I think we found it.

646
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,427
Sir.

647
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,980
We got it! Bullseye!

648
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,778
It's an ambush! Ambush!

649
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,746
Arms out! To battle!

650
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,000
Here's what I think.

651
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,294
- We don't kill them all.
- Oh, you're dead!

652
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,924
I guess that's that.

653
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,137
Shall we, then? Let's go!

654
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,772
No. No!

655
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,816
He… he's here! The blue-robed god!

656
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,449
General!

657
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,598
Look who we have here.

658
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:48,311
I have been wondering
who the blue-robed god could be.

659
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,063
You're the blue-robed god?

660
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,732
That scar I gave you
is pretty distinctive, isn't it?

661
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,694
Looks real nice. Want another one?
Your other cheek looks lonely.

662
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,906
He says he could give you
the same pretty scar on the other side.

663
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,742
Sure. Why not?

664
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,786
You are still such a joker.

665
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,914
Have you eaten?
You're not hungry, are you?

666
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,458
- He's asking if you've eaten.
- Well, no.

667
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,503
I never eat breakfast!

668
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,700
You son of a…

669
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,911
Bastards!

670
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,332
You bastards!

671
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,630
You little rat!

672
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,304
What the…

673
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,409
Ha!

674
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,256
<i>Chujo-ryu?</i>

675
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,727
Thanks to me,

676
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,190
soon you'll be able to see your nose
even without a mirror!

677
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,331
Hmm? Hmm?

678
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,518
- General!
- We must get out of here!

679
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,519
They've got us…

680
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,775
- Do not interfere.
- This is a duel between us.

681
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,860
He wants a duel with you.

682
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,574
Cheon-yeong!

683
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,913
You're still fighting, really?
Do you know how long ago we finished?

684
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,208
It's all under control.
I'll end this right now.

685
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,293
Sounds like they beat our men.

686
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,129
The general said
to capture them alive. Got it?

687
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,924
It doesn't sound
like they'll kill us.

688
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,425
- Does he mean it?
- What?

689
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,887
He wants the king to see them.
Proof of our victory and whatnot.

690
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,223
Remember, we need to take them alive.

691
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:15,601
I mean, that's the only way
we're getting paid or freed.

692
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,853
This gonna take long?

693
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,063
No, you can just sit there
and watch the show.

694
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:22,400
They'll use us as bait
to strike a deal with the king.

695
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,863
Never mind.
Just give him the net.

696
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,537
No, don't do it!

697
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,832
What the hell is this?

698
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,378
- Call yourself a warrior?
- What's he saying?

699
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,005
Uh…

700
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,300
He's upset that the duel wasn't… um…

701
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,386
- Goddamnit.
- Sheesh.

702
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,764
I was just about to get in there
and end it with a powerful blow.

703
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,687
So this is
the infamous Nose Snatcher.

704
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,147
It's the goblin helmet.

705
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,482
Wait, we just caught the Nose Snatcher?

706
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,192
The Nose Snatcher?!

707
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:09,322
The devil that'll cut
your nose off while you're still alive?

708
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,283
Look at this gold!

709
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,577
We can build ourselves a village
with all this.

710
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,370
- Whoa.
- The rumors are true.

711
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,915
The Japanese remnants
have squirreled away treasure.

712
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,082
Really?

713
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,292
Let me have a look.

714
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,169
Huh, not bad.

715
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,797
I will deliver this to the king.
Let's put it all back, then.

716
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,717
What?

717
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,972
Our duty now
is to deliver this gold to Hanyang.

718
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,768
The royal court will return these
to their rightful owners.

719
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,521
- Rightful, my ass.
- Hey, hey.

720
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,816
Beom-dong, where are you going?

721
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,527
- Water. Water!
- Me first!

722
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,953
So you're the famous Nose Snatcher?

723
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,874
Are you the Nose Snatcher?

724
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,214
How could you do this?

725
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,341
He wants water too.

726
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,552
And I wanted a rice ball seven years ago.

727
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,263
He said
you didn't give him rice balls, remember?

728
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,932
On about rice again?

729
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:21,602
You knew the <i>Chujo-ryu </i>technique.
Who taught you?

730
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,562
- What is he saying?
- Huh?

731
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,273
The short sword technique.

732
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,276
My lord wonders
who taught you the short sword technique.

733
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,947
Someone in Namwon
with a rabbit-shaped helmet.

734
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,700
Someone who was wearing
a hare-shaped helmet in Namwon.

735
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,993
Friend of yours?

736
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,537
His technique was interesting,
so I took it.

737
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,206
His technique was…
You just picked it up?

738
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,124
Mm-hmm.

739
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,917
He learned it
while fighting.

740
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,170
When I plunged my sword
into his stomach,

741
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,424
everything inside just gushed out.

742
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,261
He cut his stomach open,
and his intestines gushed out.

743
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,639
I would like a rematch.

744
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,267
He says he wants another duel.

745
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,060
The outcome will be no different.

746
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,979
The outcome won't change.

747
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:09,233
Go ahead and kill me, then…
like a true warrior!

748
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,111
He says, in that case, he'd rather die.

749
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,908
Unfortunately, I still need you alive.

750
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,619
So just sit tight and look pretty.

751
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,789
He said he has a use for you.

752
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:29,003
What is it you are hiding
underneath that red cloth?

753
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:33,049
He wants to know
what you're protecting on your hand.

754
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,656
You got scarred while you were training.

755
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,128
So that, from now on,

756
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,006
you'll always remember
why you came in first.

757
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:34,443
Being offered a position
in the Royal Guard

758
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,821
so soon after your exam.

759
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,950
I came to talk
about Cheon-yeong's release.

760
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,123
I started as a guard
just like your grandfather before me.

761
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,333
I worked the border regions
for many years.

762
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,418
I underwent many hardships.

763
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,131
- Father, please.
- The elders are waiting. Let us go.

764
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,675
You gave him your word. You promised!

765
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,263
How embarrassing.

766
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,515
Are you letting that slave rub off on you?

767
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,190
He brought home the royal flowers, Father.
How can you go back on your word?

768
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,362
Cheon-yeong kept his word as a slave,
and now you, as a noble, can't--

769
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,613
You fool!

770
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,534
We would both be dead right now

771
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,121
if the king learned
that your test results were fabricated.

772
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:36,338
Cheon-yeong's already…
all prepared to leave.

773
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:41,427
Very well.
Gwang-yi must be ready by now as well.

774
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,101
Celebrate!

775
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,814
Where is that rat?

776
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,569
- He's not here.
- Gwang-yi, you bastard!

777
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,324
We were told to catch him,
but we don't have to bring him back alive.

778
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,241
Master's orders.

779
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:06,911
Just try it.

780
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,122
And I'll cut your arm right off
at the shoulder.

781
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,089
Then I shall bring him back.

782
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,692
Cheon… Cheon-yeong.

783
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,365
You said you'd bring my papers.

784
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,825
Where are they?

785
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,787
Thank God you're safe.

786
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,958
I was so worried, Cheon-yeong.

787
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,510
Run away.

788
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,846
Go fight the Mongols
at the northern border,

789
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,015
or go to the south and fight pirates.

790
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,185
I heard slaves
sometimes get freed after enlisting.

791
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:16,939
- Make sure you don't get captured--
- Listen.

792
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,736
Am I still your friend?

793
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,242
Yes.

794
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,100
Oh, oh.

795
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,604
So you're saying these are all appeals

796
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,357
requesting that Kim Ja-ryeong
and his squadron

797
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,151
get recognized for their achievements?

798
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,778
Across the country, I hear it said,

799
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:08,657
"Sun-sin protects our seas,
while Ja-ryeong protects our lands."

800
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,659
Ah. Hmm.

801
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:18,167
But then, Admiral Sun-sin
died for his country.

802
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,710
Ja-ryeong did not.

803
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:24,173
And not a single report
on the construction of the palace is here,

804
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,174
is it?

805
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,968
The Palace Construction
Agency created a budget

806
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,013
and estimated
the number of workers necessary,

807
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,933
and concluded that it is not something
we can afford presently.

808
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,583
I'm sorry, kid.

809
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:10,677
Look at that perfect posture!

810
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,307
That's great!

811
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,309
Beautiful!

812
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,065
Now that's some ugly fucking hair.

813
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,650
Looks Japanese, doesn't it?

814
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,237
These greedy pigs make me sick.

815
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,280
Thank you.

816
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:36,078
The people who actually fought the enemy
have to gnaw on corpses

817
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:37,371
just to stay alive.

818
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,916
But the ones who got
in bed with the enemy,

819
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:44,753
they're feasting on ribs
and having the time of their lives.

820
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,006
"Meat is meat, either way." Is that it?

821
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,675
This cannot stand.

822
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,261
The mayor of Cheongju is a traitor.

823
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,305
- We must inform His Majesty.
- And that'll do what?

824
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:59,101
No, not even gouging out his throat
will be good enough.

825
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,310
Hey, Cheon-yeong!

826
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,941
- You better be kidding.
- We have a long road ahead.

827
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,360
I don't wanna argue.

828
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,821
I'd rather get some sleep.

829
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,202
Well, in that case…

830
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,539
let's all just part here.

831
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,502
To tell you the truth,

832
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,549
I get sick of you going on and on
all the time about "His Majesty,"

833
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,760
and I can't stand to be around someone
who cares as little as you do!

834
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:37,514
Well, it's not as though we were planning
on sticking together forever.

835
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,184
Let's just give up
and go back where we belong.

836
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,436
Right.
Go back to where we belong.

837
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,980
Yes, fine.
Hope you get your freedom, then.

838
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,733
While you're at it, get a title too.

839
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,277
Have a nice life.

840
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,529
While it is true
that the court once lost its way,

841
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,032
the seven-year war has run its course.

842
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:57,826
And with the talented Crown Prince,

843
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,287
I'm certain the court
will regain its dignity.

844
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,499
We must trust the government
to reward the just

845
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,875
and to punish the unjust!

846
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:07,544
I can't! It's killing me!

847
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,756
I feel like I can't breathe!

848
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,299
I can't do this anymore!

849
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,765
This is why the idea of harmony,

850
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,060
that we could all live together,
regardless of birthrights and class,

851
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,854
is… just a dream.

852
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,113
Even so, General…

853
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:39,076
…in all my life, I've only met
one true nobleman.

854
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,329
Thank you for everything, General.

855
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,292
I wish you good health.

856
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,214
The Nose Snatcher is ours!

857
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,967
All that's left to do to get our freedom
is to bring him to the court!

858
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,262
What's gotten into all of you?
It's absurd to quit now!

859
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,098
Beom-dong!

860
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,934
- Let's go.
- Hey, let's go. Everyone get up.

861
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,980
Cheon-yeong, take care of the general.

862
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,440
An internal conflict has erupted.

863
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,823
Mr. Tactician!

864
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,127
Damn, it looks even worse up close.

865
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,338
- Huh?
- Yeah, it's Japanese as hell.

866
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,841
What'd I say? I told you so.

867
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,972
We should leave one sack
in front of each home.

868
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,891
First time having rice in years,
I'd imagine.

869
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,644
- We should eat up first.
- Ah, right.

870
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,856
- Wow, that looks delicious.
- Here, I brought some more.

871
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,401
- Can't remember the last time I ate rice.
- I can't either.

872
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:55,986
Don't you know who I am?!

873
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:59,906
I am the mayor of Cheongju,
appointed by His Majesty himself.

874
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,700
Where are your Confucian virtues?

875
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,619
I say you're just ignorant beasts!

876
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,955
Confucian virtues?

877
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:12,210
The only virtues I know of…
are those of the flail.

878
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,092
WEST GATE, HANYANG

879
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:25,223
General Kim Ja-ryeong is here!
General Kim Ja-ryeong is here!

880
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:36,318
- Oh, we were so worried for you.
- Yes, yes, thank you so much.

881
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:37,861
Get off me!

882
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:45,035
Please, the corrupt officials
are even worse than the Japanese!

883
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:48,080
We starve, yet they work us like dogs
to rebuild the palace!

884
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:52,125
I will relay all your worries
to the king myself, so just

885
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,670
a little patience is all I ask.

886
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:11,144
Ja-ryeong's won the hearts
of the populace, it seems.

887
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,397
Don't you agree?

888
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,159
You would think he's a Ming emperor.

889
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,329
Such enthusiastic cheers
for a mere general.

890
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,333
How does this hero's welcome sit with you?

891
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:41,550
The ignorant masses are easily swayed
by absurd tales of grandeur,

892
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,260
but the truth will be revealed.

893
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,637
Your Majesty need not be concerned by it.

894
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:50,434
What is it?

895
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,353
A letter
from the Chungcheong district inspector.

896
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,938
I was told it was an urgent matter.

897
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,318
The Cheongju mayor was killed
a few days ago.

898
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,779
Word has it
that it was Kim Ja-ryeong's people.

899
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,367
What is it?

900
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,968
- Step back!
- Everyone be silent!

901
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,261
Step back!

902
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:36,480
General Kim, His Majesty
requests a private audience with you.

903
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:38,523
Huh.

904
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,944
I don't think His Majesty
would appreciate my smell.

905
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:00,003
Ah, right.

906
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,173
I know he'll ask your name
as it's written.

907
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,052
Which "Cheon" and which "young"
should I say you use to write it?

908
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,429
It doesn't matter.

909
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,974
It no longer has any meaning.

910
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,310
I think "sky" and "brilliant,"
like "shining."

911
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:19,231
That's what I would have picked
were I your father.

912
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:22,609
We'll speak later.

913
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,409
We have meat and liquor
prepared for all of you.

914
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,621
You must be famished
after that long journey. Follow me.

915
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:37,707
Let's go have some meat!

916
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:38,917
Quickly!

917
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:47,926
It isn't as though Ja-ryeong
himself killed the Cheongju mayor.

918
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,471
However, he led them for seven years.

919
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,681
<i>That cannot be.</i>

920
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,309
Ja-ryeong is a Confucian scholar.

921
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,688
I do not see him
as such an ignorant scoundrel.

922
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:07,821
I want him brought here
so I can question him myself.

923
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:22,794
By the king's command,
seize the traitorous rebel Kim Ja-ryeong!

924
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,133
- Huh?
- Huh?

925
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,719
What?
I thought we were having a feast.

926
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:33,847
What? What?

927
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:41,980
They're all guilty of treason.
Death upon the traitorous bastards!

928
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,863
Rebellion.

929
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:09,507
I used the blunt edge of my sword
to not kill any of the king's guards.

930
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,842
Do you understand?

931
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,929
Now tell the king

932
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:17,724
General Kim Ja-ryeong
formally requests an audience.

933
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,079
What are you waiting for?
Seize him!

934
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,343
After him!

935
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,691
You are obliged to speak.

936
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:11,528
My body rages with a burning fire.

937
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:16,032
There's no way to tame it,
so I keep my mouth shut.

938
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,367
Burning, you say?

939
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,286
Were you chewing a pepper?

940
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,288
Where did your virtue go?

941
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:26,668
Did it meet the same fate as your palace
and turn to ash?

942
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,253
Did you hear that?

943
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,756
Even this traitor agrees

944
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,134
the Confucian virtues dictate,

945
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,387
a palace is necessary
for a king to rule unimpeded.

946
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,098
Spoken like a true Confucian scholar.

947
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,563
Beom-dong, you…

948
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,692
you never even learned to read,

949
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:55,030
yet… you read this world clear as day.

950
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,670
- Oh my goodness.
- The general, a traitor?

951
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:12,172
I can't believe this.

952
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,218
Well, the years have certainly flown by,
haven't they?

953
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,229
Cheon-yeong has returned
to greet his young master.

954
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:12,041
Even a dog in a brothel gets to eat rice
if he jumps up and catches a thief,

955
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,168
doesn't he?

956
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,754
Yet Our Majesty,
who promised us freedom and honor,

957
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,049
frames us and kills us.

958
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,929
Like your father,
he stabbed us in the back.

959
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,477
A dog that bites has to be put down.

960
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:38,693
Still, I'd hoped you'd turn out different,
Jong-ryeo.

961
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,154
You traitor!

962
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,532
How dare you speak of betrayal, huh?

963
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,170
Ah!

964
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,932
Aah!

965
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:22,153
I was a fool for ever befriending you
like I did.

966
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,990
For that, I resent myself.

967
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,202
Not my problem.

968
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,920
I should have just…
just raised a dog instead.

969
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,505
There it is.

970
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,384
You sure
that's not just your wife talking?

971
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:34,017
Cheon-yeong, you animal!

972
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,619
- Over there!
- Hurry!

973
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:04,380
Branded a traitor by the Kingdom,

974
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,343
so then a traitor I shall be.

975
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:10,803
Hurry!

976
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,771
After him! There!

977
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:26,027
TRAITOR JEONG YEO-RIP OK-NAM,
SON OF THE TRAITOR JEONG YEO-RIP

978
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,613
The heads that were hanging
are gone!

979
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:43,002
{\an8}REVOLT

980
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:49,550
I executed Ja-ryeong,
following your loyal advice.

981
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,472
Now I'm drowning in appeals.

982
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,603
Thousands are calling on me
to right this wrong.

983
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,231
They hold you responsible for this.

984
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,651
Riots are breaking out
all over the country.

985
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,237
What am I to do?

986
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,833
Oh!

987
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:26,087
{\an8}How absolutely exquisite.

988
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:30,466
This was found in Joseon,
completely untouched?

989
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:31,801
According to the Nose Snatcher,

990
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:35,888
the Japanese remnants were planning
to bring the treasure here in chests

991
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,975
to offer them as gifts to you,
Your Majesty.

992
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,395
Treasure chests, you say?

993
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,148
If there's truly that much treasure, then…

994
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,233
We can sell it to traders
of Ming antiques.

995
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:50,278
And raise the funds necessary
for the restoration of…

996
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:55,241
Tell me, where…
where is this treasure, hmm?

997
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,577
Where?

998
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:09,672
I AM YI JONG-RYEO
OF THE ROYAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU

999
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:11,048
Yi Jong-ryeo?

1000
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,349
What is it that you want?

1001
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,269
The blue-robed god.

1002
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,528
Why don't we use the surrendered Japanese
for this?

1003
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,532
We bring them into our ranks
and have them search in secret.

1004
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,075
Hmm.

1005
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,333
The councilors would never
let me hear the end of it, would they?

1006
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,545
If we say the Japanese remnants
are there to quell the riots…

1007
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:53,382
Two birds with one stone.

1008
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:58,804
We can suppress the civil uprising
while simultaneously finding the treasure.

1009
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,307
And what remains of Ja-ryeong's followers

1010
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:04,477
will be completely wiped out.

1011
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:07,146
The surrendered general

1012
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:11,526
will be allowed to lead a unit
of the remaining Japanese

1013
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,736
and will henceforth be known
as Kim Choong-myeon.

1014
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:18,199
Your Majesty! I say the Japanese general
should be beheaded immediately, my lord.

1015
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:22,161
Yet you'll have him kill more of our own?
I beg you reconsider, sire.

1016
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,872
We beg you reconsider, sire.

1017
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:28,251
They burned down the palace.

1018
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,587
They even attempted
to murder their own king.

1019
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,465
Subjects, huh?

1020
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,427
They're not even human, I say!

1021
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:47,019
In the past, I established a military unit

1022
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,565
<i>made up solely</i>
<i>of surrendered Japanese soldiers.</i>

1023
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:55,152
At first, the people had doubts,
but my reasoning was sound.

1024
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:58,447
<i>Choong-myeon is now my loyal subject,</i>

1025
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:01,534
<i>so his past is now irrelevant.</i>

1026
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:05,371
<i>Furthermore, Yi Jong-ryeo</i>
<i>of the Investigation Bureau,</i>

1027
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:07,623
<i>I appoint you Chief of Punitive Forces.</i>

1028
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:11,502
You will lead the newly formed unit
to take down the traitors.

1029
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,671
You will bring swift justice
upon them all.

1030
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,798
I, Yi Jong-ryeo,

1031
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,594
am grateful for this chance
to serve Your Majesty

1032
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,138
and to rebuild our great nation.

1033
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:03,596
Huh? Hey, <i>hyung-nim.</i>

1034
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:04,805
<i>Hyung-nim!</i>

1035
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,934
What happened to you?

1036
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,104
Thought you'd be a king's guard by now.

1037
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:14,649
What happened to you? You're a mess.

1038
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,818
Whoa, <i>hyung-nim!</i>

1039
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,975
Hey. Hey!

1040
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,605
What did I say, huh?

1041
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:02,697
What did I tell you?!
I told you not to go there!

1042
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,116
Did I not?! What did I tell you?!

1043
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,367
Let go!

1044
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:08,202
- Enough.
- What did I say?!

1045
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:10,496
I told you they were full of shit!

1046
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,249
All so that you could live a better life.

1047
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,793
- I said enough.
- Look where it got you, huh?!

1048
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:19,046
Look what you did!

1049
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:22,842
Look at what you've done!

1050
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,593
There, there.

1051
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,182
Hey, Cheon-yeong, get up.

1052
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,643
- I wanna have a duel.
- Just talk it out.

1053
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,562
Hey, come on now!

1054
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:40,025
Now what the fuck is that?!

1055
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,820
- You gotta honor the king first, really?
- Enough!

1056
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,074
RAT

1057
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,996
Let this be the end of it.

1058
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,192
You can fight in a war
and come home a hero,

1059
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:24,195
but if you rebel,
there's a chance you might not come back.

1060
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:30,117
Whether by Japanese swords
or under the blade of the king,

1061
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,703
it's all the same thing.

1062
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:36,540
Plus, how can we pull off a revolution
when there's only 30 of us here?

1063
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,794
Come on, it's simple.
Our homeland is falling apart.

1064
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:44,048
Put up a damn poster.
We'll have more here than we can count.

1065
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,258
How will we feed and clothe them, then?

1066
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:50,262
Wait, you said it yourself, sir.
The Japanese forces have buried treasure.

1067
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:51,514
Wait a minute.

1068
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:56,101
When we caught the Nose Snatcher,
the rats had these big empty wagons.

1069
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:59,438
What's the point of hauling them
all the way out to the woods unless…

1070
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,316
They were gonna use them
to move the hidden treasure.

1071
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,069
Come to think of it, there were marks
on some of the older trees.

1072
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:06,403
That's right. Remember?

1073
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,989
Of course. Yes. Let's check it out.

1074
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:12,910
The key to a revolution is speed.
We need to hurry.

1075
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,412
- Here. I think this was the spot.
- Here.

1076
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:17,122
Look, there it is!

1077
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,209
Careful, careful, careful.
Let's see, let's see!

1078
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:21,710
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1079
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,420
- Whoa.
- We did it.

1080
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,756
We found the treasure!

1081
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,263
We need
at least two more wagons.

1082
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:34,473
And where are we gonna find those?

1083
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:37,268
Let's pull the rest on horseback.

1084
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,978
Yeah, I guess we could do that.

1085
01:37:39,061 --> 01:37:42,231
I don't think it's anything
you need to concern yourselves with.

1086
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,734
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

1087
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,611
Have you lost your damn minds?

1088
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,697
You think we're Japanese or something?!

1089
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,365
Stay still, dammit!

1090
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,909
If bringing change to this nation
is worth risking your life,

1091
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:54,910
stand over there.

1092
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:58,455
But if you wish to take this treasure
and split it among us,

1093
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,291
then stand over here.

1094
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,840
After fighting for more than seven years,
what did it all mean?

1095
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:11,176
If you want to live free,
then grab your belongings

1096
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:12,887
and come to me.

1097
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,263
That's not freedom!

1098
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:16,932
If you truly want freedom,
it's gotta be won.

1099
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,560
We can't afford to stop.
If we do, they'll keep coming.

1100
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:21,312
We'll be targets forever!

1101
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:23,022
Until we end up dead!

1102
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,525
I don't wanna hear this drivel.

1103
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:31,614
If you want me to bash your head in,
then by all means, stand over there.

1104
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,659
Are you serious? What are you doing?

1105
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,330
I just… Tomorrow is never guaranteed,

1106
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,916
so I'm gonna appreciate today.

1107
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,500
You disgust me.

1108
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:48,255
Kim Ja-ryeong sees what you're doing
from his grave!

1109
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,926
Now come on! Let's load it all up
and get outta here.

1110
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,387
- Beom-dong <i>noo-nim!</i>
- Let's go. Come on.

1111
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:58,015
He doesn't wanna go with you.
Let him go, at least. Kid!

1112
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:04,813
Eyes ahead.

1113
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,109
Do you want to go back?

1114
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:13,113
- Mm-hmm.
- It's certain death.

1115
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,532
Mm-hmm. Please.

1116
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:21,705
Hurry then,
before a hungry boar finds them.

1117
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,212
Good luck, kid.

Your commander, Cheon-yeong?

1131
01:40:58,343 --> 01:41:00,721
The Nose Snatcher? How could he…

1132
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:09,438
We're sending a message here.
Cut off their heads.

1133
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:21,867
Huh?

1134
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,662
Hey, Kiddo. You came back.

1135
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,097
What happened here? What the hell is this?

1136
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:50,395
Mr. Tactician.

1137
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:01,115
You should have just… died at my hands.

1138
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,911
WANTED

1139
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,627
"I will hang heads and wait."

1140
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:16,046
"Yi Jong-ryeo."

1141
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:41,822
- Take it over there. Good.
- Make sure it's tied tight.

1142
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,209
The boat should be arriving at low tide.

1143
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,504
Until then, the unit will stand guard here

1144
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,923
while another contingent
searches for the rebels.

1145
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,008
Yes, sir.

1146
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,523
How dare they!

1147
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,903
I'll kill them all, I swear.

1148
01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:24,198
Wait a minute.

1149
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,491
Something seems off.

1150
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:32,289
What the…

1151
01:43:42,507 --> 01:43:43,675
Oh, I see.

1152
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:51,016
We, too, are a military unit
that receives His Majesty's commands.

1153
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:54,519
Do you intend to commit treason too?

1154
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:57,856
What you're doing
is treasonous. The king selected--

1155
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:00,400
You were never going
to get out of here alive.

1156
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,195
You're the enemy, you see.

1157
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:05,989
He never planned
to let us leave.

1158
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:08,617
You'll make
for a good, hearty meal.

1159
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,119
We'll flay your meat
and sleep in your leather.

1160
01:44:12,537 --> 01:44:13,747
Fire!

1161
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:33,433
If the barrel is backed up,
the weapon will explode.

1162
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:36,186
Doesn't it remind you of this country?

1163
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,106
Swords out!

1164
01:44:50,325 --> 01:44:52,035
What on earth is going on?

1165
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:56,873
What a load of bullshit.

1166
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:08,385
Aah!

1167
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,237
In the fog, we'll be blinded.

1168
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,740
I don't think we can set sail
at this rate.

1169
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,658
We are in no rush.

1170
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:34,036
- Sir!
- General.

1171
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:14,785
You and the blue-robed god.
You two are so different

1172
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:17,704
yet mirror images at a certain angle.

1173
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:23,043
What exactly are you to each other,
you and he?

1174
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:25,921
What's your relationship
with the blue-robed god?

1175
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:28,298
You're the same, and yet…
and yet you're different.

1176
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:42,437
The anger
in your sword is different from his.

1177
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:46,942
So why does he… Why did
the blue-robed god have your sword?

1178
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:49,403
Did he steal it?

1179
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:53,365
Did the blue-robed god
steal your sword?

1180
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:55,826
I gave it willingly.

1181
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:58,078
He says he gave it to him.

1182
01:46:58,912 --> 01:46:59,955
I will not kill you.

1183
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:03,291
You'll be valuable
when it comes to negotiations.

1184
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,795
You'll be more useful to us
as a bargaining chip than dead,

1185
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:08,463
so my lord will not kill you.

1186
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:29,443
You're both
of the same kind.

1187
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:33,280
I will treat you… equally.

1188
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,287
It's the blue-robed god!

1189
01:48:01,099 --> 01:48:02,851
The blue-robed god.

1190
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:05,145
I have a use for him,

1191
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:06,980
so be nice and keep him alive.

1192
01:48:07,063 --> 01:48:11,151
He has a use for him,
so my lord wants you to keep him alive.

1193
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,236
I'll just kill you both.

1194
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,556
Bring… bring me my foot.

1195
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,891
Oh fuck, I'm…

1196
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,352
Are you all right, sir?

1197
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,540
You little shit!

1198
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:27,435
Sh…

1199
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:03,638
Got you!

1200
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:14,733
You lowly bitch!

1201
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:00,654
Don't cry over a scratch.

1202
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:05,283
Not when others died
with their heads cut off.

1203
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,330
And some burned to death.

1204
01:51:11,456 --> 01:51:14,626
I'll rip your limbs off
and tear you to shreds,

1205
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:18,880
and I'll take all of those pieces
and burn them away.

1206
01:51:18,963 --> 01:51:20,757
This is for my father!

1207
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:24,094
My mother, my son!

1208
01:51:26,388 --> 01:51:29,891
As my wife suffered, so shall you!

1209
01:51:39,234 --> 01:51:41,444
Is that what you thought
happened all along?

1210
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:46,366
Or is that something you chose to believe?

1211
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:48,702
I really tried to save them,

1212
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:52,038
but she willingly jumped
into the raging fire

1213
01:51:53,456 --> 01:51:54,958
with your son in her arms.

1214
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,668
You liar!

1215
01:51:58,378 --> 01:52:00,171
That's a goddamn lie!

1216
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:03,299
Why would she?

1217
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:06,803
Why?!

1218
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:10,265
And she said I was a brute at the end.

1219
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:21,067
I'm getting tired of waiting.

1220
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:14,866
Cheon-yeong.

1221
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,660
Am I still…

1222
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:22,957
still your friend?

1223
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:46,397
Cheon-yeong, I'm…

1224
01:55:49,108 --> 01:55:50,276
so sorry.

1225
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:01,204
Jong-ryeo.

1226
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:31,609
Ah, it is exactly how I envisioned it.

1227
01:56:31,693 --> 01:56:34,696
Just like in my dream. Hmm.

1228
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,783
- Now what about…
- Ah, yes, Your Majesty?

1229
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:41,202
The pine trees on Namsan, then.
Is it done?

1230
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:43,371
Uh… Well, you see…

1231
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,582
The trees hold a lot of moisture
in the summer, so…

1232
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:48,876
Mm! Tsk!

1233
01:56:50,628 --> 01:56:53,589
- It is I, Eunuch Kim.
- Enter.

1234
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:01,305
I was told that a cargo vessel
arrived at Hangangjin, sire.

1235
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:03,933
It bears the royal insignia and…

1236
01:57:10,606 --> 01:57:12,942
Is Jong-ryeo still nowhere to be found?

1237
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:16,487
They searched every part of the vessel,
but there was no sign he was there.

1238
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:18,906
Are you saying the ship
sailed here on its own?

1239
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:24,245
The entire unit disappearing
with no witnesses… It makes no sense.

1240
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:26,205
Oh!

1241
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:28,166
Excellent.

1242
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:30,001
Hurry up and open them.

1243
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:36,299
Why is this taking so long?

1244
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:39,010
Over here! This one's open, sire.

1245
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:42,346
Oh! The rest of you, keep going.

1246
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:43,514
Sire!

1247
01:57:48,644 --> 01:57:49,812
All right, open it.

1248
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,873
Huh? What does this salt mean?

1249
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:12,502
- My lord, this one is open!
- This one too.

1250
01:58:12,585 --> 01:58:14,087
- We opened ours too.
- We got this one!

1251
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,130
- We got it open!
- This one is also open!

1252
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:18,716
- Jab and pull it out.
- Sire.

1253
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:24,138
Just push it on its side.

1254
01:58:27,475 --> 01:58:28,476
Hmm?

1255
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:30,103
Huh?

1256
01:58:40,822 --> 01:58:41,823
What?

1257
01:58:45,743 --> 01:58:47,537
Aah!

1258
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:49,622
- Your Majesty!
- Oh! Ah!

1259
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:53,417
Your Majesty.

1260
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:09,350
CHAOS

1261
01:59:09,934 --> 01:59:10,935
{\an8}KING

1262
01:59:11,018 --> 01:59:15,231
Attention!

1263
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:22,405
To punish those who leech off the people,
we must all join forces!

1264
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:23,739
That's right!

1265
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:27,118
Just like this strong, fearsome brute!

1266
01:59:27,201 --> 01:59:29,704
Hey!

1267
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:32,748
Here, eat him up!

1268
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:39,130
The characters for the word
"brute" are the same

1269
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:42,925
as the ones used for "the masses."

1270
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:43,968
That's true.

1271
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:49,682
Since the masses are beasts,
it is only right that they fear us!

1272
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:13,247
No better way to join forces
than to form a community.

1273
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:15,458
I think we should give ourselves
a new name

1274
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:17,585
since the Great Unity didn't work out.

1275
02:00:18,669 --> 02:00:20,338
Beom-dong works, doesn't it?

1276
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,507
"A world together," meaning all of us.

1277
02:00:24,133 --> 02:00:26,177
Beom… dong.

1278
02:00:32,183 --> 02:00:33,935
Those characters fit perfectly.

1279
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:35,853
Does that mean
I'm the boss, then?

1280
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:38,689
Do we really need a boss?

1281
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:42,485
Let's have some fun! Whoo!

1282
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:44,528
Sounds good. Let's do it!
