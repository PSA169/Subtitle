[children playing]

4
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:50,746
Give me the bucket.

5
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,182
When I'm done with it.

6
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,533
Just give it to me!

7
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,884
Ron! Alan tried to take
my bucket from me!

8
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,499
Give it!
I'm gonna get--

9
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,196
-This is mine now.
-Hey, no fair!

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,938
Give it back, Uncle Ron!

11
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,331
I don't think so.

12
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,897
Not until the two of
you learn to quiet down.

13
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,857
Besides, I've got a place
for my empties.

14
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,090
Tag, you're it!

15
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,440
Hey, no fair! We're not
supposed to go swimming!

16
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,141
You're still it!
You'll never catch me!

17
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,277
You'll never tag me!

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,495
I'm trying!

19
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,107
Ugh!

20
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,504
Tag, you're it!
You'll never catch me.

21
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,993
Danny?

22
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:05,429
Danny, this isn't funny!

23
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,174
Tag, you're it!

24
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:12,306
I'm gonna get you!

25
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,655
Nuh-uh!

26
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,700
Tag, you're it!

27
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,408
Ah, something's biting!
Ah!

28
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,193
Help me!
Help me!

29
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,934
Ah!

30
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:38,506
No!

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,992
Danny...

32
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,867
Welcome back to KQNT Radio.

33
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,521
We're so excited about

34
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,916
the Lake Havasu fishing
tournament this weekend.

35
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,789
We at KQNT are setting up a
booth with all sorts of swag.

36
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,314
Stop on by and say hi.
We will be there.

37
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,838
But whether or not the fish
will is a whole other story.

38
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,341
[bell rings]

39
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,258
Welcome.

40
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,868
Have a seat
wherever you like.

41
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,961
You know you can
just roll them, right?

42
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,832
You know you can always help me
with the heavy lifting, right?

43
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,532
Yeah, that's what I thought.

44
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,144
Anyway, Sienna,
whenever you're done

45
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,145
with that silverware,
you can go.

46
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,451
It's pretty dead.

47
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,497
Woo-hoo!
Don't gotta tell me twice.

48
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,238
I'm going to the beach.
It's gonna be crazy when people

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,327
start showing up for
the fishing tournament.

50
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,983
I'll spend as much time
there as I can now.

51
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,768
Yeah, if people show up.

52
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,074
Hey there, welcome
to the Corner bar,

53
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,250
home of our
famous fish sandwich.

54
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,207
What can I get you?

55
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,689
You look really familiar.

56
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,125
Did we go to school together?

57
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,475
Maybe.

58
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,738
I lived here 20 years ago.

59
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:06,480
Yes!
Yes, Alan!

60
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,699
Lisa, we went
to grade school together.

61
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,572
Do you remember me?

62
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,705
I don't remember much
from that time, to be honest.

63
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,534
Well, you're really
remembered around here.

64
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,319
I mean,
you were the brother who...

65
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,060
Lived?

66
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,063
Yeah.

67
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,196
I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

68
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,153
Don't worry about it.

69
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:37,162
Whatever happened
to you after... You know.

70
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,512
You know what,
don't answer that.

71
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:39,861
I'm so sorry.

72
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,384
I just--

73
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,994
You know, you and your
parents left--

74
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,693
We just couldn't be
around here anymore.

75
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,303
Too many memories.

76
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,742
I'll be at the beach
with friends till sunset.

77
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,788
See you tonight?

78
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,355
Hey, be careful.
Love you.

79
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,227
Can I get you a drink?

80
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,230
No thanks.
I don't drink.

81
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,449
What are you doing at a bar?

82
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,189
-Um...
-[bell rings]

83
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,669
-I gotta piss.
-You always gotta piss.

84
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,236
Of course, man, I've got
of a small bladder.

85
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,846
What do you want from me, okay?

86
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,631
Just waiting for someone.

87
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,415
Hey, Lisa, I'm gonna hit
the john,

88
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,025
but Ron said he's got
the first round of drinks.

89
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,462
Yeah, right.

90
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,028
Yeah, ain't no one
buying that, Bobby.

91
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,856
You haven't paid your
tab from last week.

92
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,512
Evening, Lisa, usual for me.

93
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,000
Alan?

94
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,916
I didn't know
you were in town.

95
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,873
Ron!

96
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,441
What the hell?

97
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,790
Lisa, call the cops.

98
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,705
No need, no need.

99
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,054
I deserve that.

100
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,755
Bobby, get off him.

101
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,062
That's 20 years overdue.

102
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,282
To the day.

103
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,114
You left us.

104
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:02,422
We were kids,
and you left us alone.

105
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,600
And I'm sorry.

106
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:07,905
Truly.

107
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,170
But I told you kids,
don't go in the water.

108
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,738
We were children, Ron!

109
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,610
What the hell did you
think was gonna happen?

110
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:20,091
How could I have known a shark
would make it past the dam?

111
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:45,943
You gonna go after him?

112
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,643
It's a small town.
I'll see him again.

113
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:52,907
Hey, man.
Ron, Ron.

114
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,343
You good?

115
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,953
Yeah, yeah. I...

116
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,868
I just need to clear my head.

117
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,958
Wanna get back out on the water?

118
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,569
Go out for some Yellowtail
with my new spear?

119
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,049
If there's any out there,
that is.

120
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,095
Maybe tomorrow.

121
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,010
I'll catch you later.

122
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,359
Sounds good.
Hey, Ron.

123
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Just be careful.

124
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,193
I'll catch you later.

125
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,508
-Thanks.
-No problem.

126
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,947
I didn't realize
Ron was there that day.

127
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:37,125
That's just it.

128
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,256
He wasn't.

129
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,784
That explains a lot about Ron.

130
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,919
It's a shame I can't
get you a real drink.

131
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,532
How about a food menu?

132
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,446
That, I can do.
Be right back.

133
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,973
-Running low.
-I can get that for you.

134
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,257
[reel whirs]

135
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,312
All right...

136
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:35,792
All right.
Come on.

137
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:39,317
Come to daddy.
That's it. Come on.

138
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,754
Oh, you a big one, huh?

139
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:43,104
All right. All right.

140
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh!
Whoa!

141
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,543
Jesus Christ!

142
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,949
Damn!

143
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,223
Here you go.

144
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,311
Thanks.

145
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,058
Hey, I'm...

146
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,234
I'm sorry about
what happened with Ron.

147
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,323
You may get another shot.

148
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,108
Tends to come in daily
for the fish sandwich.

149
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:34,416
Although with you here now,
he might try to avoid the place.

150
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,287
But seeing as how
Mayor Stewart's coming around

151
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,637
to talk about
the fishing tournament,

152
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,812
he still may swing by.

153
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,250
Is that why you came back?

154
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,773
No.

155
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,557
Okay, please tell me
you didn't come back

156
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,385
just to punch Ron
in the face.

157
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,431
No, uh...

158
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,741
I don't know.

159
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,917
20 years, I haven't been able
to get a good night's sleep

160
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,528
because of what
happened that day.

161
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,792
It's hard to get rid of the
things that I saw in my head.

162
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,795
I think I'm just
looking for some closure.

163
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,886
You know, Ron had
said a while back

164
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,889
that they might even
change the name of it

165
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,850
to the Danny Rogers Memorial
Fishing Tournament.

166
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,199
At least that's
what I heard, anyway.

167
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,638
I'm just glad he'll
be remembered.

168
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:32,387
I remember you used to make
these crazy birdhouses

169
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,650
and stuff like that.

170
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,566
Those intricate sand castles.

171
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:38,741
Did you ever do anything
with that?

172
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:44,965
I can't believe you
remember those. Umm...

173
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:49,926
Yeah, I'm actually trying
to get into architecture.

174
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,102
I've sort of been floating
around from job to job

175
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,321
for a while now, so...

176
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,329
Anyway, I hope you at least
stick around for the memorial.

177
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,897
That is, if they don't
cancel the tournament.

178
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:07,378
Why would they cancel it?

179
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,989
Isn't it like one of the
biggest events of the year?

180
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:10,860
Yeah, it used to be.

181
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,427
But you need fish for
a fishing tournament

182
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,908
and haven't seen one
around here in days.

183
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,867
In fact, it's been dwindling
every year now for ages.

184
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,390
In the past couple months,
I mean,

185
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,088
we've been pretty much dead.

186
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,567
Why don't they just stock it?

187
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,917
You know, fly in fish
from somewhere else?

188
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,485
They tried,
maybe ten years ago.

189
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,793
Most of the fish just up
and died from the shock.

190
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,143
See, we have a pretty
unusual ecosystem.

191
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,623
We have the lake with
all the fresh water

192
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,929
and then we have salt water
also coming in,

193
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:39,933
so it's just a big disaster.

194
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,022
But it's probably why our
fish sandwich tastes so good,

195
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,632
so what can you do?

196
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,245
Also why that shark was
able to survive in the lake.

197
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,422
Yeah.

198
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,163
Yeah, you're probably right.

199
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,478
You want me to
blow a hole in the dam?

200
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,915
I don't want to.

201
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,179
But it's for the greater
good of this town.

202
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,835
If Jerry leaves me no choice,
my hands might be tied.

203
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,490
We can't have a fishing
tournament without any fish,

204
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:19,102
and there's plenty of them
just outside that dam.

205
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:20,538
I think that's something
I can do.

206
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:22,932
For a price.

207
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,936
Name it.

208
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,808
15K.

209
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,375
That should do the
trick, though.

210
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,988
That's barring I don't run into
any unforeseen circumstances.

211
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,946
You know how these
things go, Mayor.

212
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,517
I think I can make this happen.

213
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,693
Good.

214
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,303
Mayor, we have a problem.

215
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,739
Miss Mayor, I'm so sorry.
Your brother just...

216
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,046
Can wait a moment, Will.

217
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,832
Outside by the door, please.

218
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,442
Ann, you can go
back to your desk.

219
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,791
Look, I hate to pull
the brother card--

220
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,620
I said you can wait
a moment, okay?

221
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,589
Get whatever equipment you need.

222
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,765
I will reimburse you.

223
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,681
Everything I have left
in the budget is yours,

224
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,683
if plan A doesn't work.

225
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:21,208
Which I'm really hoping
we don't have to go to this.

226
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,779
I will contact you if your
services are necessary.

227
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,261
Good deal.

228
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,046
You let me know
when you need me.

229
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:35,831
Thank you.

230
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,105
What do you want, Will?

231
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,107
I don't know how to say
this exactly, Wendy,

232
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:54,197
but I was fishing outside the
dam today and I saw a shark.

233
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,546
[chuckles]
Okay.

234
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,634
A shark.

235
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,853
Outside the dam.

236
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,376
Big one, too.

237
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,204
Great white from the look
of the dorsal.

238
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,553
How did it even get there?

239
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,294
There's not an ocean for miles.

240
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,601
I'm assuming the same way
as last time.

241
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,256
At least this one's
outside the dam.

242
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,519
But a shark made it
through 20 years ago.

243
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,174
Who's to say
it won't happen again?

244
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,350
Are you accusing me of
something?

245
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,004
I'm not saying that.

246
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,093
Then what are you saying?

247
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,225
I'm just saying that for
the small fee of,

248
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,923
let's say, 16 grand...

249
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,664
Okay, okay. I'm going to cut
you off right there.

250
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,797
Even if I did have
enough funds

251
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,626
to support my little brother's
big fishing dream,

252
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,890
I'd have to believe you that
there's a shark out there.

253
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,721
So you'll understand if I don't
partake upon your services.

254
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,505
But it is out there.

255
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,986
All right, now this tournament
is important to this town.

256
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,642
Don't you dare lecture me on
what's important to this town.

257
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:50,993
While you've been out there
fishing the last remaining fish,

258
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,517
I've been here trying
to save this town

259
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,084
and keep it alive.

260
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,218
This fishing tournament
brings in enough revenue

261
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,742
to keep this town afloat
for the rest of the year.

262
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,225
Without it, I fear
that our town is...

263
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:11,971
I don't have enough money
for your services, Will.

264
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,800
Which is extortion,
given that we're family.

265
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,978
My budget is all tied
up at the moment.

266
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,762
Even if I did believe you.

267
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,332
That's all, Will.

268
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,771
It's your funeral.

269
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,381
[chuckles]
Okay.

270
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,469
-And the town's.
-Mm-hmm.

271
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,309
Now, first things first.

272
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,311
I want dispel the news

273
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,400
that we were considering

274
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,272
cancelling the
fishing tournament.

275
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,971
There is nothing,
and I mean nothing,

276
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,321
that could get me to pull
the plug on this event.

277
00:16:58,365 --> 00:16:59,583
-[applause]
-Woo!

278
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,284
Now, my husband and I,

279
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:07,678
we signed up for the very
first fishing tournament.

280
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,812
And we have fished
every last one.

281
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:15,512
And this year, on the fifth
anniversary of his passing,

282
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:19,429
I am excited to announce
that we are officially

283
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,518
changing the name

284
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:25,087
to the Raymond Stewart
Memorial Fishing Tournament.

285
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,046
[applause]

286
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:33,661
So, I look forward to seeing all
of your boats out on the water.

287
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:39,101
And may the best fisherman
or fisherladies

288
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,844
win this year's
$10,000 grand prize.

289
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,759
[applause]

290
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,286
Mayor, Mayor Stewart.

291
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,766
Good to see you.

292
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:52,984
I don't know if you remember me.

293
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,551
My name is Alan Rogers.

294
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,901
Um... Yes, Alan Rogers.

295
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,468
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,775
I am so very,
very sorry

297
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:03,604
about what happened to your
brother so many years ago.

298
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,041
If you need anything,
just let me know.

299
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,609
That's what I wanted to...

300
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,872
Jerry, I wanted to talk
to you about dam...

301
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,112
You got your gear?

302
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,418
I wasn't expecting
you to call so soon.

303
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,550
Let me guess.

304
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:37,942
Plan A didn't go as you hoped.

305
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,596
Do you have your gear?

306
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,250
And I mean all your gear.

307
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,730
You know I got all my gear.

308
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,514
What's going on, Mayor?
I'm down.

309
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,864
Perfect.

310
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,736
Head to the dam.

311
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,434
I need you to rig
one of your explosives

312
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,959
under the water onto the dam.

313
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,310
Make sure the explosive
is large enough

314
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,312
to let fish swim in,

315
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,706
but not so large
to breach the surface.

316
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,016
The hole cannot, cannot be
visible from above the water.

317
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,192
You got that?

318
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,847
Okay, copy that, Mayor.
I can do that.

319
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,675
But how much we
talking this time?

320
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,024
At least another 10k, right?

321
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,982
Yeah.

322
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,028
Call me if you run
into any trouble.

323
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,205
We'll figure out the rest
when the job is done.

324
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,128
Hey, Edward.

325
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:38,002
Will. What's going on?

326
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,221
Not much.

327
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,570
Stocked for the night?

328
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,528
New truck?

329
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,184
What do you want, Will?

330
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,707
I couldn't help but overhear

331
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,187
you were on the phone
with my sister.

332
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,320
What do you need, Will?

333
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,412
Just think you might want
to know what I know.

334
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,849
Especially if you really want
to make a whole lot more money

335
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,111
than you already are.

336
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,420
What do you know?

337
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:07,902
We got a shark on the water.

338
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,389
-Yeah.
-Thanks for the heads up.

339
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,450
[phone rings]

340
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:41,283
Mayor, I've made
it to the dam.

341
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,111
Good.

342
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,983
Please tell me you're not
getting cold feet, are you?

343
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,029
Oh, no, I'm not
getting cold feet.

344
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,639
I'm getting cold hands.

345
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,119
Your price just went up.

346
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,947
Why?

347
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,949
I've run into your brother
on the way over here.

348
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:59,823
And he told me I might run
into some pretty nasty stuff.

349
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,435
And that ups my risk
considerably.

350
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,263
And that's gonna cost you.

351
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:08,310
Look, just because
my idiot brother

352
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,573
says he saw a shark,

353
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,096
doesn't mean there is one.

354
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,881
He has no evidence.

355
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:17,276
So just get in and get out.

356
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,149
And if there is a shark,
which again, there is no proof,

357
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,586
then I will just have
Will take care of it.

358
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,458
No, no, no, no, no.

359
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:28,287
He sounded pretty
sure about this.

360
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,158
You know what?

361
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,942
Mayor, maybe I should
just pack my stuff up and--

362
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,293
Okay, fine.

363
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,513
I will give you
an extra $10,000.

364
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,341
10K?

365
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,691
If that's the price
it takes to get it done,

366
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:45,739
then just get it done.
It is the grand prize money.

367
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,568
And make sure that the hole
goes all the way through.

368
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,919
And that it's big enough to
let in a whole mess of fish.

369
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,574
But not so big to let
the so-called shark get in.

370
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,053
Or you will get nothing.

371
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,766
Oh, yeah.

372
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,243
[beeping]

373
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,210
[muffled explosion]

374
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,518
Let's check out the damage.

375
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,147
[shouts]

376
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,846
Come on!

377
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,334
[muffled scream]

378
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,340
[screams]

379
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:20,720
Hey there, stranger.

380
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,331
Hi.

381
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,334
What are you doing out
here all alone?

382
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,992
This is the beach where Danny...

383
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:34,647
Yeah.

384
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:38,302
Yeah, it's my, um...

385
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,913
first time back since.

386
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,486
You know you don't have
to go through this alone.

387
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,838
Ron is heartbroken
about what happened.

388
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:55,406
That... drunk...

389
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,192
picked getting beer over
watching kids on the beach.

390
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,284
I can never forgive that.

391
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,593
You should know,
Ron doesn't drink anymore.

392
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,899
[scoffs]

393
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,206
I'm not lying, it's the truth.

394
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,904
I swear, I've worked at
the Corner Bar for over a decade

395
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:17,559
and he's never once come in
and asked for a drink.

396
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:20,214
He just likes the fish sandwich.

397
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,520
And the company, I mean.

398
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,828
I appreciate the company.

399
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,091
But I can safely say
I'm fine without the fish.

400
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,225
Are you leaving?

401
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,925
I always promised
myself I'd come back.

402
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,189
And I heard they were going
to be honoring my brother.

403
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,452
Thought maybe I'd get
a little closure.

404
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:46,588
But now that they're not,
there's nothing left for me.

405
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,592
Well, you can't leave just yet.

406
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,595
Not until you at least
try the fish sandwich.

407
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,510
-I don't like fish.
-You'll like ours.

408
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,773
We're world famous, you know.

409
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,993
Really is the best
thing this town has to offer.

410
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,084
Is that so?

411
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:06,042
Better swing by for lunch.

412
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,610
It'll be on the house.

413
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,046
Besides, I can't let you
leave your hometown

414
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,222
on an empty stomach.

415
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,355
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go take

416
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,226
my morning swim before
I open up the bar.

417
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,751
I'll catch you later?

418
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,450
Yeah.

419
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:26,019
Yeah, well, uh... we'll see.

420
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:29,500
You know what?
I think I'll just jog today.

421
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:31,938
Maybe I'll open up the bar
a little early, just for you.

422
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,810
How does that sound?

423
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,075
If you're going to go
through all the trouble,

424
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,077
I might swing by
in a little while.

425
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:48,345
Well, you sure better.
I hate jogging.

426
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,173
See you at the bar.

427
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:48,231
Found these out by the dam.

428
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:51,104
Inside, heading
towards the lake.

429
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:52,714
I recognize Edwin's gear.

430
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,412
So he gave his life
to open the dam.

431
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:56,675
And now we got
a shark in the lake.

432
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,549
What do you want now, Will?

433
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,335
Same thing as you want.

434
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,511
To be rid of the shark.

435
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,863
And to make a whole lot
of money this weekend.

436
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:14,388
Yeah, well I'm not
paying you $60,000.

437
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,738
Your fee is too high.

438
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,348
Did I ever tell
you how I got this?

439
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,526
I don't need to know, Will.

440
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,919
She was my first.

441
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,795
Had a dozen since then.

442
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,145
And every one of
them has prepared me

443
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,712
more for this than the last.

444
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:40,370
See that's what you're
paying for, my experience.

445
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,372
I'm running out of money, Will.

446
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,376
We need this tournament
to go well.

447
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,075
Otherwise we're all in trouble.

448
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:55,559
This is our last chance
to make enough money

449
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,040
to keep our city afloat.

450
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,913
And then we have time
to look at a new budget.

451
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,831
If not, we will be
completely governed by the state

452
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,702
and I'll be out on my ass.

453
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,270
And you're my brother.

454
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,924
They'll run you out
of town as well.

455
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:21,194
Okay.

456
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:24,632
If you can't pay me,
maybe I can outsource the job.

457
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,287
Someone local.

458
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,636
Just get it done.

459
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,005
Hey there, Bobby.

460
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,833
Anything biting today?

461
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,835
Eh, a couple of nibbles.

462
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,402
-More than usual.
-Yeah?

463
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,230
You hear that rumor
we might have a shark

464
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,666
back in these waters?

465
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,841
Great white.

466
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,452
No way. You kidding?

467
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,280
Seen it with my own eyes.

468
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,195
Mayor wants it gone
before the tourney.

469
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:09,633
She's not coming up to
my budget level.

470
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,592
So I figured I'd see if
a young up and comer

471
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:14,334
such as yourself wants to take
a crack at his first shark.

472
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,465
What do you say?

473
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,513
I'm thinking I'm glad I just
picked this puppy up, huh?

474
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:21,994
Yeah, it wasn't cheap, but
I wanted it my whole life.

475
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,909
Aluminum stainless
steel construction,

476
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:26,172
copper tip,
20 foot retrieval line.

477
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:28,652
One good shot from this and
it's nighty night Great White.

478
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:29,871
You know what I mean?

479
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,525
That's why I came to you, Bobby.

480
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:34,223
Hey, you kill that shark,

481
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,791
you ain't never going to have to
buy a beer in this town again.

482
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,228
Now you're talking my language.

483
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,535
Now look, my sister
wants it kept quiet.

484
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:44,625
So if and, of course when

485
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:47,758
you do land it,
do so discreetly.

486
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:48,759
You understand, right?

487
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,587
Of course, boss.

488
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:51,850
That's a good man, Bobby.

489
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,068
Well, go on!

490
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,461
Get out there and
nab yourself a shark!

491
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,855
All right. Yeah, I'm going
to grab me a shark!

492
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,384
Hey, Ron.

493
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,472
Beautiful day.

494
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,740
Did you say there's a shark?

495
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,916
Shark?

496
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,875
No, I said there was a
muskie as big as a shark

497
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,877
out there somewhere.

498
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,227
Little Bobby ain't never
caught nothing like that,

499
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,925
wants to hang it on his wall.

500
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,318
I told him he
should try his luck.

501
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:28,451
See you around, Ron.

502
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:46,817
[bell rings]

503
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:54,434
Lisa, your favorite
new customer is here.

504
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,306
Just a second.

505
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,786
She'll be right with you.

506
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,266
Thanks.

507
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,357
Hey, you.

508
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,836
You decided to come back?

509
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,969
It's like you said.

510
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,797
Can't leave town on
an empty stomach.

511
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,365
So can I try to convert you
with that sandwich, now?

512
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,801
They say it's world famous.

513
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,542
All right.
Coming right up.

514
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,499
[bell rings]

515
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,289
Cancel that, Lisa.
I'm leaving.

516
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,812
Now, hold on just a minute, son.

517
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,988
Don't "son" me, okay?

518
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,124
No, you know what?
I got nothing to say to you.

519
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,473
They found a shark.

520
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:41,350
-What did you say?
-They found a shark.

521
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,353
Will Ealy was telling
Bobby Newbanks about it

522
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,964
and sent him off to
do his dirty work.

523
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,140
You don't think it's...

524
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,793
The same one?

525
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:52,971
They can live 70 years.
It's not impossible.

526
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,498
Look, I know we...
we don't have to get along,

527
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,978
but I have some gear on my boat.

528
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,892
I know how to do this.

529
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,546
Sorry to interrupt, but look,

530
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,287
before you guys
do anything too crazy,

531
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,595
maybe we should just let
Will and Bobby handle this.

532
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,727
Okay? I mean, it can't be too
safe to have all those boats

533
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,251
on the water going
after the same thing

534
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,774
at the same time, right?

535
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,602
If this shark is back,
then we need to find

536
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,778
a way to kill it before
it hurts anyone else.

537
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,301
I need to find a way.

538
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,347
You haven't been on the water
in 20 years.

539
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,305
You'll just get yourself
hurt out there.

540
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,393
You need me.

541
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:27,005
I don't need you.

542
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,355
With what boat are
you going out on?

543
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,531
-What's your plan?
-I don't need a plan.

544
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,923
Yes, you do.

545
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,317
You do or you'll end up like...

546
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:38,016
Hey, hey, take it easy.

547
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,365
Easy, guys.
Come on.

548
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,150
Settle down.

549
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:47,895
All right.

550
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,246
Let's come up with a plan.

551
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,034
Maybe on a full stomach?

552
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,819
I'll have the usual, Lisa.

553
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,345
Okay, see?
This is good.

554
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:05,130
We're off to a good start.

555
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,131
Be right back.

556
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,703
So, um...

557
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:16,010
I didn't see you
at your mom's funeral.

558
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,751
The service was--

559
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:19,883
How about we just focus
on dealing with the shark?

560
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:22,886
Okay.

561
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,421
Where are you?

562
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,302
And I brought you a
nice little snack.

563
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,787
You want some more?
Sure...

564
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,097
All right.

565
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,315
-[thud]
-Oh!

566
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,760
Ah!

567
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:11,848
Got you!

568
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,546
[grunts]

569
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,504
Oh goddamn you are strong!

570
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,984
Oh, you're a big mofo,
aren't you?

571
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,855
[grunting]

572
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:21,249
Oh, and I'll bet
you're ugly, too.

573
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:24,296
Come on. Come on.
Let me get a good look at you.

574
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,559
[grunting]

575
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,304
Goddamn driftwood.

576
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:40,225
[grunts]

577
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,965
Come on.

578
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,751
[grunts]

579
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,579
Come on!
God!

580
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:51,758
Oh, shit!

581
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,848
Oh, shit! Shit!
Come on!

582
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,287
[grunts]

583
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:01,985
Oh, shit!

584
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,727
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Shit!

585
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,339
Anybody.
Help me out, man.

586
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,949
Come on. Come on.

587
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,517
-[thud]
-Ah!

588
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:26,532
All right, boys,
here you go.

589
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:28,751
Hope you like it.

590
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:45,246
Something's off.

591
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,206
Told you people would notice.

592
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,555
Notice what?

593
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,296
Don't you have
some dishes to do?

594
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,472
Ugh, I hate dishes.

595
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,605
Besides, we're dead,
except for these two.

596
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,041
I thought I was
done for the day.

597
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,869
I wanted to meet up
with some friends.

598
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:03,090
Nope. We still have inventory to
do before the tourists arrive.

599
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:06,049
Fine.

600
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:08,051
Sorry, guys.

601
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,271
Normally we like
to use local fish,

602
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,577
but because the
fishing's been so bad,

603
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,882
we had to use frozen.

604
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:13,883
It's not gonna
taste the same.

605
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,887
Taste's world famous to me.

606
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,238
Told you it would.

607
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,153
But I am nervous.

608
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,720
People come from all
over specifically

609
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,201
for those sandwiches
during the tournament.

610
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,638
The pay bump we get every
year is what keeps us open.

611
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,251
This tournament's
gonna happen tomorrow,

612
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,817
then we find a way to
get rid of that shark.

613
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,648
So what are we gonna do?

614
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,737
I mean, we could try talking
to the mayor about it.

615
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,435
See if she has any ideas.

616
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,437
At least to get
these beaches closed.

617
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,003
Fat chance.

618
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:49,310
She probably put the shark
in the water

619
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,269
for some big tourism stunt.

620
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,316
Coe on, Bobby, pick up.

621
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,187
Okay, well, either way,
we have to convince her

622
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:58,885
to get those people out
of the water right away

623
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,148
and keep them out.

624
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:03,150
We'll need to come up
with a plan first.

625
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:04,934
Otherwise I doubt she'll
listen to us.

626
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,548
Bobby's not picking up.
I'm going on the water.

627
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,987
Hey....
Not without me, you're not.

628
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,423
Alan, I don't want to hear it.

629
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,425
You haven't been on
a boat in decades.

630
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,254
You'll just get in my way
and get someone hurt.

631
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,823
Right now, I need
to find Bobby alone.

632
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:25,694
Maybe I can help him
to see the shark.

633
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:26,782
Okay, but I can...

634
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,090
I'm not losing you, too.

635
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,787
You hear me?

636
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,181
That's final.

637
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,272
You'll hear from me soon,
I promise.

638
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,583
[bell rings]

639
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:47,890
He's right.

640
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,806
It's not safe for anyone who's
not experienced on the water.

641
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,852
Which is exactly why we
need to talk to the mayor

642
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,201
and get those beaches closed.

643
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,470
[phone chimes]

644
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,237
[phone rings]

645
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,502
Sienna, hello?

646
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,200
Are you there?
Can you talk?

647
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,377
-Chelsey?
-Hey!

648
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,379
Don't ask me how I pulled
this off, but I'm on my way.

649
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,815
-You can come?
-Yes.

650
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,033
-Cool.
-I'll see you at the beach.

651
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:45,513
Great, we'll save you a spot.

652
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,585
[engine starts]

653
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,786
[grunts]

654
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,705
Oh, shit.

655
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,150
Look, if the mayor isn't there,

656
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,543
I'll go to her house
and find her.

657
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,153
I don't care.

658
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,763
We need to find a way
to close these beaches

659
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,330
and take care of this shark.

660
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:04,984
You should come with me.

661
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:08,030
Yeah, like I could every leave
this place unattended.

662
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,815
You know, the second I would,
we'd get a huge rush.

663
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:14,689
Yeah, I'd go by myself, but
based off of our last encounter,

664
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:18,171
I don't think she's too
interested in talking to me.

665
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:19,738
You're a local.

666
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,783
She might actually
listen to you.

667
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:23,393
You think your sister
could handle the place

668
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,134
for an hour or two by herself?

669
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,528
She can barely
handle the dishes.

670
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,095
Wait, speaking of...

671
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,662
Sienna, you done
with those dishes yet?

672
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,055
Sienna!

673
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:43,413
-Hey!
-Girl, hey!

674
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:44,676
Hi.

675
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,816
-This is a nice spot.
-Yeah.

676
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,733
[giggling]

677
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,650
Bobby!

678
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,436
Bobby!

679
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,527
Bobby!

680
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,195
[thud]

681
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,372
Oh, you...

682
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,120
Where'd you go?

683
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:39,078
Where are you?

684
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,081
Come on!

685
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:45,084
That's right. That's right.

686
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,041
Come on.

687
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:49,131
Come on!

688
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,785
[grunts]

689
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:53,614
Shit. Shit.

690
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:57,444
[engine sputters]

691
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:58,576
Oh, no, no, no.

692
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,796
Come on!

693
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:41,488
Come on.

694
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:43,795
[grunts]

695
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,243
[grunts]

696
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:02,727
Yes! Ha!

697
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,773
I got you! I got you!

698
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:22,529
Shit.

699
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,712
Come on, guys.
Let's play volleyball.

700
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,583
[phone vibrates]

701
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:36,761
Sienna?
Hey, Sienna.

702
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:40,765
No, thank you.
I'm off the clock.

703
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,288
Hey!

704
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:43,681
It's not funny.

705
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:46,205
We need you.
Let's go.

706
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,641
I swear to God,
if you don't pick up the phone,

707
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,729
I will strangle you.

708
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:52,951
Why wouldn't she tell you?

709
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,301
You two seem close.

710
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,520
She does this sometimes.

711
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:58,783
Please leave a message.

712
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,436
Sienna, so help me,

713
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,786
if you're not back in this
bar in 10 minutes,

714
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:03,265
I will hunt you down and
drag you back.

715
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,704
Sisters.

716
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:10,577
I'm going to check the
kitchen one more time.

717
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:12,884
Sienna?

718
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:21,153
Stop!

719
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:22,632
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

720
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,690
[phone vibrates]

721
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,265
Shark!

722
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,919
Get out of the water!

723
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:51,357
Get out of the water!

724
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,144
Shark! Shark!
Get out of the water!

725
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:13,771
Shark!

726
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:18,340
Shark! Shark!
Get out of the water now!

727
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:20,778
[screaming]

728
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,788
Sienna!

729
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:35,836
[shouting]

730
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:43,191
[shrieks]

731
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:44,802
[screaming]

732
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,157
[screaming]

733
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,211
I got you!
I got you.

734
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:05,039
It's going to be okay.

735
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,304
I got you.

736
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:10,915
[crying]

737
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,352
I got you.

738
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:19,575
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

739
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,795
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep your eyes open.

740
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,362
Keep your eyes open.
Look at me.

741
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:25,930
Let me see your eyes.
Keep your eyes open.

742
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,540
This is going to hurt.

743
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,585
[screams]

744
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,152
It's all right.
It's all right.

745
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:32,414
It's done. It's done.
It's done.

746
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,546
It's done.
It's done.

747
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,374
Hey, hey.

748
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:38,333
I'm going to call 911
and get you some help.

749
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:40,248
Hello, emergency.

750
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:43,382
Yeah.
Hey, I need an ambulance ASAP.

751
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,775
Lakeshore... I don't know.
Ping my phone.

752
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:46,776
Find out where I am.

753
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,387
Send an ambulance to your ASAP.

754
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,084
Shark attack victim.

755
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:04,838
She still isn't picking up.

756
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:08,624
None of her friends, not Ron.

757
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,496
Hey, hey.

758
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,411
We'll find her on the beach.

759
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,545
You're right.

760
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,417
I know you're right.

761
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,073
Just... she makes me so mad when
she doesn't answer her phone.

762
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,465
[siren blaring]

763
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:29,471
No...

764
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:33,301
Wait...

765
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:34,389
Lisa!

766
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:37,740
Ron!

767
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,657
Ron!

768
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:45,661
Oh my God.
Oh my God, what happened?

769
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:49,404
Your sister. The shark.

770
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,450
Where?

771
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:52,930
Where is she?
Where is she, Ron?

772
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:55,019
I put her in an ambulance.

773
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:56,977
You can catch up with her
on the way to the hospital.

774
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,414
[sobs]

775
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,764
-Lisa.
-Don't you Lisa me!

776
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,984
You out of all people
should understand.

777
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,555
I'm going to the hospital.

778
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:10,556
Hey, Lisa, let me drive you.

779
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,210
No. I'll get an Uber.

780
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:13,515
You get that shark.

781
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,952
It's your brother
all over again.

782
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:22,350
You always say that
I wasn't there.

783
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:23,786
That I left you.

784
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,399
But I never left.

785
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:30,271
I'm still on that beach
20 years ago.

786
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:33,274
Every night when I go to sleep.

787
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:35,189
There's nothing I can do.

788
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,496
I see your brother's death.

789
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,932
I hear him screaming.

790
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,588
Every goddamn night.

791
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:49,682
I never wanted your forgiveness.
Or your mom's.

792
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:52,163
But I need you to trust me.
when I say

793
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:56,123
you can't possibly hate me
as much as I hate myself.

794
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:59,692
I have blood on my hands that
will never ever wash off.

795
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,740
Not unless we can stop
this from ever happening

796
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,046
to anyone ever again.

797
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,268
But I need your help.

798
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,488
I can't fight this thing alone.

799
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,795
And I'm not waiting for
anyone's permission.

800
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,537
Not the mayor, not Jerry,
not anyone's.

801
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,193
I will do whatever I need to
to get rid of that shark.

802
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:24,673
I can't get that thing
out of my head.

803
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:28,547
With the damn scar
over its eye.

804
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,985
Not for 20 years.

805
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,294
So what do we do?

806
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,740
Picked out some lighter spears.

807
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:51,613
I fought it once already.
I know how fast it moves.

808
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:55,226
Mentally, I'm more prepared now.

809
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,186
Where do you think it came from?

810
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,883
Not sure.

811
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:04,191
Dam's been closed for
two decades ever since...

812
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:05,540
Right.

813
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,631
Is there any other way
for it to get in?

814
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,677
No.

815
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,114
Lake has but one entrance.

816
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:20,947
We need to make sure that dam's
as closed off as we think it is.

817
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,557
Good idea.

818
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:48,496
We tied up yet?

819
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,802
Yeah.

820
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,328
Anything look unusual to you?

821
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:57,157
Not that I can see.

822
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,333
So this isn't a normal dam.

823
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:01,335
The lake is pretty
much sea level,

824
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,468
so a hole wouldn't
cause massive flooding.

825
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:05,426
The breach could be underwater.

826
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,688
I'll grab my gear
and check it out.

827
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:07,863
No, I can go.

828
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:10,301
No. Ron...

829
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:12,085
I got this.

830
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,347
Okay.

831
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:15,001
Be careful.

832
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:18,004
You see anything down there,
you come right on up.

833
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,193
Ha!

834
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:38,198
See anything?

835
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:39,591
You were right.

836
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:41,593
Looks like they blew
a hole in the dam.

837
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:43,377
Sure it's not just worn out?

838
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:45,118
That thing's older than hell.

839
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,598
Scorch marks all
around the hole.

840
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:47,860
Plus, it's huge.

841
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:51,342
Anything could get
through there.

842
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:54,083
How the hell does
the owner not know about this?

843
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:58,653
Is there no alarm system,
pressure monitor, something?

844
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:03,049
No, the dam is old.
It predates that technology.

845
00:53:03,092 --> 00:53:04,877
Plus, we haven't had
any rain

846
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,010
or any crazy weather
this past few days.

847
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,708
And it looks totally fine
from up here,

848
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:11,710
so there's no cause for alarm
to look down there.

849
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:14,800
That hole is huge.

850
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:17,324
There's no way it'll get
fixed before the tournament.

851
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:19,587
It's going to take
a construction crew

852
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:23,548
months to fix it.

853
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:25,071
We need to close it
off somehow.

854
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,247
If we close it off,
the shark can't get out.

855
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,423
Yeah, but if we don't,
more can get in.

856
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:32,296
Hey, it's better to trap that
one in here and finish this off.

857
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,601
Solve the problem for good.

858
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:36,169
That's a good point.

859
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:39,085
So how do we close it?

860
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,179
Oh, yeah.

861
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,441
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

862
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,314
This should do the trick.

863
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:52,577
Sure it won't get
torn to shreds?

864
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,056
Trapped it in this
once already.

865
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:57,059
It got loose, but
if we secure it

866
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,191
with something more...

867
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:02,804
shark proof.

868
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:04,545
Braided steel fishing line.

869
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:06,025
Strongest there is.

870
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:07,635
I'll patch this into the net,

871
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,637
then you just need to secure
it using the hooks.

872
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,423
-Sound good?
-On it.

873
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:23,782
There.

874
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,480
Should be as tough
as we need it.

875
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,009
-Good?
-Yep.

876
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:38,710
I'll head down and secure these.

877
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:41,321
Be quick. I'm going to try
and get Jerry on the horn.

878
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,323
See if you can do something
a little more permanent.

879
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,759
All right.

880
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:10,132
Jerry, give me a call
the second you get this.

881
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,575
Shark!

882
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,185
Shark!

883
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:21,709
Alan!
Come on, what are you doing?

884
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,232
Get out of the water.

885
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:24,799
Get to the boat!

886
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:29,282
[grunts]

887
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:36,376
Come on, get in the boat.
Get in the boat.

888
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,421
In the boat.

889
00:55:37,464 --> 00:55:40,424
Come on.
Come on.

890
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:41,599
Here, here, here.

891
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:45,994
Dry off.

892
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:47,779
Dry off. Warm up.

893
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,130
It's the same shark.

894
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:54,263
I saw the scar on the eye.

895
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:56,396
What?

896
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,705
It's the same shark that
killed--

897
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,315
[phone rings]

898
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,146
Jerry, meet me at the corner
of our parking lot ASAP.

899
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:09,627
Yes, now!
This can't wait!

900
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:15,763
You all right?

901
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,072
[tires screech]

902
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:22,204
[doors slam]

903
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:23,554
Jerry!

904
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,557
-Hey.
-Hey.

905
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,993
So what's going on?

906
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:29,168
Someone blew a hole in the dam.

907
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:31,300
-What?
-Shark got through.

908
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:32,780
It attacked Sienna on the beach.

909
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:34,434
She's in critical condition.

910
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,001
Jesus!
What the hell happened?

911
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:38,438
I mean, I was just at
that dam earlier today.

912
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,309
I mean, everything looked fine.

913
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:44,749
Can't see it from the surface.
It's under the water.

914
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,054
Trust me, it's there.

915
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:48,448
We put one of my
big fishing nets over

916
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,581
to stop anything big
from coming through,

917
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,365
but we got a real problem.

918
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,063
It's the same shark
that killed my brother,

919
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:56,891
and it's killing people again.

920
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,025
How do you know
it's the same shark?

921
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:02,984
It has the same scar.
I'll never forget it.

922
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:04,551
Hey, we need to spread the word.

923
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,771
Get people away from the water.

924
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:09,904
You know, this is
exactly why I kept that dam

925
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,080
closed for the past 20 years.

926
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:13,778
That's why I told the mayor

927
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:15,257
that I wouldn't
open it up for her this year.

928
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:17,042
The mayor?

929
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:18,478
Yeah.

930
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,088
She asked me right here
in this bar

931
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:22,177
just a couple of days ago.
I said I wouldn't do it.

932
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:24,658
Not after what happened
20 years ago.

933
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:26,704
She's got to repair
this thing once and for all.

934
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:29,010
Triple reinforce,
the whole nine yards.

935
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:31,622
What?

936
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:34,494
I can't believe
she stooped that low.

937
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,931
Something is going
on with our mayor.

938
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:40,108
This is even low for her.

939
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:41,501
We need to keep an eye on her

940
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,503
before she gets somebody
else hurt, you hear me?

941
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,462
Let me just go see
what I can do.

942
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:46,593
Thanks, Jerry.

943
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:50,989
We should go to the city hall.

944
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:56,821
Lisa?

945
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:58,605
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

946
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,524
I can't afford to stay closed
for a whole day.

947
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:05,699
People are showing up.

948
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,277
Hey, are you okay?

949
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:22,281
How's Sienna?
She okay?

950
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,286
She's still critical.

951
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:32,117
Thank you for pulling
her out of the water

952
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,119
and for calling an ambulance.

953
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:35,729
It's okay.

954
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:37,035
A lot of emotions.

955
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,387
Lisa, you should
go spend some time with--

956
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,564
I have to power through.
I don't have a choice.

957
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,219
We're gonna be way too busy this
weekend with the tournament.

958
00:58:47,262 --> 00:58:50,265
The tournament's
gonna get canceled.

959
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:52,659
I mean, after
what just happened...

960
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,139
You didn't hear?

961
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:57,011
The mayor's not
canceling the tournament.

962
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:59,927
She's offering a cash
prize for killing the shark.

963
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,756
What?

964
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,802
We gotta talk
some sense into her.

965
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,545
Hey...

966
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:09,937
It's gonna be okay.

967
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:16,683
We'll be right back.

968
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:34,048
Mayor Stewart, there's
some fishermen here early

969
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,311
already out in the
water wondering if killing

970
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:38,618
the you-know-what is gonna
be paid out in cash or...

971
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,402
You can tell them it
will be paid

972
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:42,491
in whatever form they want.

973
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,189
I will make sure of it.

974
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,365
Now, if you could
leave us Ann, please.

975
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:56,854
You're making a huge mistake.

976
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,421
I'm out of options, Will.

977
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,423
With all of those
people getting hurt

978
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,295
and killed out there,

979
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:07,647
if they trace it back to me,
I'm ruined.

980
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:12,478
Those people out there
aren't experts, not like me.

981
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:15,263
You got dozens of people hunting
the same fish for prize money.

982
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:18,136
It's dangerous, right?

983
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:19,659
More people will get hurt.

984
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:22,270
That shark won't get caught.

985
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:23,576
What do you expect me to do?

986
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,711
Just hire me.

987
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:29,190
Yeah, your rate?

988
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:33,064
Is now the family rate.

989
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:37,459
Look, Bobby and Edwin
were dear friends of mine.

990
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,810
And that poor girl...

991
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,072
I just want it done.

992
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:42,464
Thank you.

993
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,555
We need this
shark dead right away.

994
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:48,296
So get it done.

995
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,560
If you don't,
I may have to handle it.

996
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,566
And I know you can handle it.

997
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,700
Let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

998
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,063
Mayor Stewart, I'm so sorry,
they just barged in.

999
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:17,064
You need to call off
the tournament

1000
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,500
and close the dam.

1001
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:19,850
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
slow down.

1002
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:21,503
One thing at a time.

1003
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:23,070
Ann, you can leave us.

1004
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:27,553
I see you never taught
your nephew any manners.

1005
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,774
No, but we taught him
to respect the respectable,

1006
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:31,775
and he takes that to heart.

1007
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:33,298
[chuckles]
Okay.

1008
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,126
All right, gentlemen.

1009
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:38,520
Well, we have experts taking
care of it on the water.

1010
01:01:38,564 --> 01:01:40,958
What about the hole in the dam?

1011
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,263
If that doesn't get fixed,

1012
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:43,787
something else could
come through,

1013
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,614
and we'll be right
back where we started.

1014
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:50,358
We cannot fix the dam until
the shark has been destroyed.

1015
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:53,884
That would require us putting
more people into the water.

1016
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:56,625
And we can't do that
until the water is safe.

1017
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,672
If the water isn't safe, then we
need to cancel the tournament.

1018
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,674
That shark has killed people,

1019
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,545
and it is going
to keep killing people.

1020
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:05,417
Which is exactly why
I have my best people

1021
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,767
hunting it down as we speak.

1022
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:11,336
My brother Will is out
there for insurance.

1023
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:16,341
He's done this before, and I am
confident that he can handle it.

1024
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,387
Once the shark is destroyed,
the tournament will be safe,

1025
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:21,868
and we'll have
nothing to worry about.

1026
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:23,783
Frankly, Ron,
I'm surprised that

1027
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,089
you're not out there
on the water.

1028
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:26,786
How dare you?

1029
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,137
You, of all people, should
want that shark destroyed.

1030
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,748
We're leaving.

1031
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:45,109
What are you thinking?

1032
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:50,070
We got to get those
fishermen off the water.

1033
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:51,115
Try and do something.

1034
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,336
She's a real piece of work.

1035
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,772
Yeah, that should stop you.

1036
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:42,601
All right.

1037
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:58,486
Nothing a little bit of good
old strychnine won't handle.

1038
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:02,055
Woo!

1039
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:35,872
All right.

1040
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:44,881
Let's see where you're at.

1041
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,451
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

1042
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:53,280
[honking]

1043
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:54,847
Calling all boats on the water.

1044
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,544
Return to shore immediately.

1045
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:58,503
Conditions are unsafe.

1046
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:01,332
I repeat, return to
shore immediately.

1047
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,681
Better be worth
all this trouble.

1048
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:08,687
Hell...

1049
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,124
I catch you...

1050
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:17,914
And the Strychnine kills you.

1051
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,224
And I'm gonna skin your lateral

1052
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:28,489
from the top of your head
to the back of your tail.

1053
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:30,274
Gonna nail you to a board.

1054
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:33,581
Dry you off.

1055
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:38,064
Salt you down.

1056
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:41,720
And let you dry out
in the sun for days

1057
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,896
till there ain't a drop
of water left in you.

1058
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:53,036
Between that and the reward
money for catching you,

1059
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,125
killing you...

1060
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:59,651
Yeah, maybe I'll pay for
that poor girl's funeral too.

1061
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,655
Wouldn't that be something?

1062
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:07,964
What you think of that?

1063
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,052
Holy shit!

1064
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,536
Come here.

1065
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,843
Come here, you great
white piece of shit.

1066
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:18,975
[gunshots]

1067
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:20,585
Head to shore, it's not safe!

1068
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:23,370
It's dangerous.
Get out of the water!

1069
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:25,677
Get off the water.

1070
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,288
-Get to shore!
-Go!

1071
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,247
-Get off--
-[gunshot]

1072
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,727
Who's shooting?

1073
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:33,728
Will.

1074
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,168
What are you doing?

1075
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,952
We gotta get those people
out of the water.

1076
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,259
Will doesn't shoot
unless he's got something.

1077
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:43,956
We gotta get to him
and that shark now.

1078
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,353
Hold on.

1079
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:59,363
Quick bastard, aren't you?

1080
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:01,626
Come on.

1081
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:03,584
Where you at?

1082
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:05,412
They're ain't a fish out here
that's bested me yet!

1083
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:06,761
You hear me?

1084
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,068
Where are you?

1085
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:12,637
There you are.

1086
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,118
Come on.
That's right.

1087
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,642
That's right.

1088
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:19,426
Keep coming.

1089
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,298
Keep coming, you son of a--

1090
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:22,299
Whoa!

1091
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:25,476
[groans]

1092
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:40,534
That's Will's boat, dead ahead.

1093
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:42,058
I don't see him.

1094
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,624
I'll bring us in closer.

1095
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,629
Oh God.
He's dead.

1096
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:49,935
What's all over him?

1097
01:07:49,978 --> 01:07:51,328
Strychnine.

1098
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,069
We'll call it in
when we get to shore.

1099
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,864
[bell rings]

1100
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:07,866
Come back tomorrow.
We're closed.

1101
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:09,433
Lisa.

1102
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:10,608
Oh, hey.

1103
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:17,441
No one else can kill this thing.

1104
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:21,009
It's on us now, but
we don't have the firepower

1105
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:23,882
that we need to get this done.

1106
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:27,103
Do you know any locals
or regulars who might?

1107
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,194
Go outside and
I'll meet you out back.

1108
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:32,804
I've got something
that'll help.

1109
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,022
Yeah?

1110
01:08:34,066 --> 01:08:35,111
Yeah.

1111
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:39,245
Just give me a bit to
gather a few things.

1112
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,349
That was fast.

1113
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:58,177
Expecting you to come
back with someone.

1114
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,005
Nope, and we don't
need anybody else.

1115
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,355
Check this out.

1116
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,661
Woo-wee.

1117
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:05,271
This is all yours?

1118
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:10,320
Dad hunted for 50 years.

1119
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,626
I never really took it up.

1120
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,194
I used to go to the range
with him all the time.

1121
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,980
220-grain bullets and a 30-06
could take down a moose.

1122
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:21,331
That'll do it.

1123
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:23,333
Now, this might be a
little bit of an overkill,

1124
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:24,812
but if we really
want this thing dead,

1125
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:25,987
this will definitely do
the trick.

1126
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,694
Wow.
Heck yeah.

1127
01:09:36,737 --> 01:09:39,044
Impressive.

1128
01:09:39,087 --> 01:09:42,178
My dad used to call 12-gauge
shotgun slugs bear medicine,

1129
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:44,484
so it should rip through
a shark no problem.

1130
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:46,834
And this ammo, even if it
gets wet, it'll still fire,

1131
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:48,271
so we don't have to
worry about the water,

1132
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:49,794
except for the shotgun
shells, of course.

1133
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,580
Lisa, this is...

1134
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:55,408
this is amazing.

1135
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,367
I'm coming with you.

1136
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,455
What?

1137
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:01,240
No. It's too dangerous.

1138
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:02,981
I don't want to see
another death on this lake,

1139
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:04,635
especially not yours.

1140
01:10:04,678 --> 01:10:07,551
This shark nearly
killed my sister.

1141
01:10:07,594 --> 01:10:09,379
I have a claim to it, too.

1142
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:11,381
And I'll be damned if either
one of you tries to stop me.

1143
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,041
All right.

1144
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,267
It's too dark for us to do
anything on the water right now.

1145
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:35,405
Let's go get some rest.
Meet be back here before dawn.

1146
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,060
Bring everything you got.

1147
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,238
Nice work.

1148
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:08,568
Hey, I'm...

1149
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:12,920
I'm here for you
if you want to talk about it.

1150
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,053
Thank you.

1151
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:19,100
Sienna's still trying
to pull through.

1152
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:21,233
Just...

1153
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,756
I'm really worried.

1154
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,105
I know how you feel.

1155
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:30,895
When I lost Danny, I...

1156
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:32,853
lost
a piece of myself that day.

1157
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:39,382
He was younger. I was...

1158
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:43,429
I always found myself protecting
him around home, at school.

1159
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,307
But the one time
it mattered most...

1160
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:54,919
I'm so sorry you had
to go through that.

1161
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:01,273
Not through it all just yet.

1162
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:21,859
Sorry I'm late.

1163
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:24,688
I want to make sure we
have enough gas to the boat.

1164
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:26,124
Let's get the gear in my truck.

1165
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,387
Get to the boat.
Hit the water.

1166
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:29,910
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

1167
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,830
Let me help you with that.

1168
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:37,831
What a gentleman.

1169
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:45,752
Think we'll be the
first on the water?

1170
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:47,188
Sure better be.

1171
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,886
-You got that?
-Yes. Thank you.

1172
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:16,609
I brought some of that frozen
fish I had in the freezer.

1173
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:18,437
We can use it for chum.

1174
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,831
This is a good use for it.

1175
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:23,573
You just have to be able
to keep its attention, too.

1176
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,444
The fishing tournament
kicks off at 9 a.m.

1177
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:28,404
Once that starts, that's
a lot of boats in the water.

1178
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,841
Hopefully that shark won't
be alive by 9 a.m.

1179
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,408
Hopefully.

1180
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:35,106
Good morning, Lake Havasu.

1181
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:38,414
And a good morning it is as
today kicks off the first day

1182
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,633
of the Raymond Stewart
Memorial Fishing Tournament.

1183
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,548
It's still early, but it
looks like we're going

1184
01:13:42,592 --> 01:13:44,376
to have a record turnout
this year.

1185
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,204
We've got clear skies
and hopefully

1186
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,771
lots of fish out there.

1187
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:49,642
Here's hoping you
catch the big one.

1188
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:03,700
Mayor Stewart,
you wanted to see me?

1189
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:07,486
Ann, yes.

1190
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,924
I need you to do me
the world's biggest favor.

1191
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:12,491
Yeah, anything for you, Mayor.

1192
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,493
Unless you hear from me,

1193
01:14:14,537 --> 01:14:17,322
keep everyone off
the water until 9 a.m.

1194
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,411
You hear me?

1195
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,632
Stall, do whatever it takes
until 9 a.m.

1196
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:23,720
Got it?

1197
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:26,374
Got it. 9 a.m.

1198
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:27,680
Why?

1199
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,599
I have to do one last
thing for this damn tournament.

1200
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:40,214
9 a.m.

1201
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:42,565
And please, keep your radio on

1202
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,784
in case we do need to
cancel this tournament.

1203
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,917
Okay, you got it, Mayor.

1204
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,442
Good luck.

1205
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,463
So sorry, everyone.

1206
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:57,640
The tournament doesn't
start until 9 a.m.

1207
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,598
So there's no boats
out there until then.

1208
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,600
I'm so sorry.

1209
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,036
[clamoring]

1210
01:16:19,836 --> 01:16:21,925
Hey, what's that?

1211
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,286
Is that blood?

1212
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,635
Blood all over the water.

1213
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:47,907
Mayor's chumming the shark

1214
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,953
away from the
fishing tournament area.

1215
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:51,737
Smart.

1216
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,697
Yeah, but what happens
if that shark gets to her?

1217
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,177
I know she can fish
but if this thing killed Will?

1218
01:16:58,352 --> 01:16:59,484
We got to find the mayor.

1219
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,139
Follow the blood.

1220
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:03,575
Everybody hang on.

1221
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,113
Mayor!

1222
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:22,028
Shit.

1223
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:24,901
Mayor Stewart,
you need to stop.

1224
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,687
No, I have to save this town.

1225
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,167
The fishing tournament--

1226
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,691
The fishing tournament
will go on as scheduled.

1227
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,867
I'm making sure of it.

1228
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:37,478
Otherwise, we don't have enough
money to run this town.

1229
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:39,437
You need to stop.

1230
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,831
Not until we kill this shark.

1231
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:45,486
We're not doing anything
until you come to your senses.

1232
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,926
None of this would
have happened if it wasn't

1233
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:52,493
for your goddamn brother
getting killed 20 years ago.

1234
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,411
Daryl or...

1235
01:17:57,455 --> 01:17:59,065
-Donnie.
-Danny.

1236
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:00,153
Yeah, Danny.

1237
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,680
If it wasn't for him,

1238
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:07,378
I would have been able to open
up the dam all that I wanted,

1239
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:09,728
let all the fish come in.

1240
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:11,338
And the fishing tournament
would be

1241
01:18:11,382 --> 01:18:14,733
the biggest tournament
in this county every year.

1242
01:18:14,777 --> 01:18:18,432
But one little boy
gets killed by a shark,

1243
01:18:18,476 --> 01:18:21,609
and the dam owner grows a spine,

1244
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:24,395
refusing to open the dam?

1245
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:28,399
And now all the fish
are caught or dying off.

1246
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:29,574
No way to bring them back.

1247
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:38,888
Every year...

1248
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,716
Every year we'd have
the tournament before that.

1249
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:44,937
And every year I would open the
dam, let all the fish come in.

1250
01:18:44,981 --> 01:18:48,767
We would make so much
money for the town.

1251
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:52,771
But one shark gets in and your
brother took that away from me.

1252
01:18:54,077 --> 01:18:56,906
You...

1253
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:01,345
20 years ago,
you opened that dam.

1254
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:03,739
You're the reason
the shark is here.

1255
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,653
You're the reason that Danny--

1256
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:07,351
We closed the dam.

1257
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:12,573
And the fishing got
worse and worse and worse.

1258
01:19:12,617 --> 01:19:14,880
And this year
it's almost completely empty.

1259
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:23,193
The town is nearly bankrupt.
Do you get it?

1260
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:28,241
So I did what any
caring mayor would do.

1261
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:32,768
I blew a goddamn hole
in the dam.

1262
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:35,335
I thought it would save
the fishing tournament.

1263
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:37,729
I thought it would
save the town.

1264
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,647
But now everybody's
getting killed.

1265
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,692
The tournament is a disaster.

1266
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:48,609
And I'll never...

1267
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:58,141
All I wanted was
to make my husband's legacy.

1268
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:02,101
The fishing tournament,
this town,

1269
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:05,061
make it everything
we dreamed it to be.

1270
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:06,802
And we still could.

1271
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:08,847
But mayor, right now
you're in danger

1272
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:10,849
and so are your citizens.

1273
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:13,156
We have to put a stop to
this tournament right now.

1274
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,160
Come on.
No one else has to die.

1275
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:25,777
Okay...

1276
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:28,519
[screams]

1277
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:30,695
Get behind me.

1278
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:38,007
Does anyone see it?

1279
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,269
I've got nothing.

1280
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:41,575
Here.

1281
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,229
[gunshots]

1282
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:46,493
Didn't get it.
It's too fast.

1283
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:48,844
Keep your eyes out.
We can't let it get away.

1284
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:49,845
Here.

1285
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:51,890
[gunshots]

1286
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:53,457
That won't kill it.

1287
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,893
But it will slow it down.

1288
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:01,682
-Anyone see it?
-I don't see it.

1289
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:04,947
I've got nothing
over here either.

1290
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,252
Damn it!

1291
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:08,037
We can't let it
get away again.

1292
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,995
It's still out there.
We've got to keep our eyes out.

1293
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,605
No, it's gone.

1294
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:15,261
We can get it back.

1295
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:24,314
Alan. Alan, hey.

1296
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:26,272
I'm sorry.

1297
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:27,534
Yeah, I know Ron.
You don't...

1298
01:21:27,578 --> 01:21:31,277
Yes, I do.

1299
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:32,713
I'm sorry I left you
and your brother

1300
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:34,237
on that beach 20 years ago.

1301
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,588
-Ron...
-I'm sorry I never called.

1302
01:21:40,678 --> 01:21:42,723
I'm sorry I never
tracked you down

1303
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:46,597
and talked
everything over with you.

1304
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,861
I had so many chances to,
but I was never brave enough.

1305
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:56,389
And maybe if I had,
we wouldn't be here right now.

1306
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:59,218
Ron...

1307
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:03,962
I can't forgive you
for what you did.

1308
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:13,580
But I'm willing to stick
around a little bit longer.

1309
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:16,757
And maybe...

1310
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:19,673
Just maybe I can
get begin that process.

1311
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:20,892
Okay?

1312
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,156
Sound good?

1313
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,418
That sounds good.

1314
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:30,119
That sounds really good.

1315
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,599
Okay.

1316
01:22:32,643 --> 01:22:35,820
Now all we have to do is find
a way to cancel the tournament.

1317
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:37,039
[thud]

1318
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,779
[screaming]

1319
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:40,303
-Lisa!
-Lisa!

1320
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,269
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1321
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:56,058
Damn it!
I can't get a clear shot.

1322
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,413
I'm not losing another one.

1323
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:06,764
Ron!

1324
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:09,810
Lisa, Lisa!
Swim to shore!

1325
01:23:09,854 --> 01:23:11,073
No! I want to help!

1326
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,335
The shark is too close
to the boat!

1327
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:14,250
Go! Now!

1328
01:23:14,293 --> 01:23:16,034
-Don't look back!
-Lisa!

1329
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:17,514
Just go!
I'll find you!

1330
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:19,081
-Go!
-Go!

1331
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,997
Ron, look out!

1332
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,266
Come here,
you son of a bitch!

1333
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:36,576
No!

1334
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:40,189
No, no, no, no!

1335
01:23:40,232 --> 01:23:42,713
Lisa! Keep swimming!

1336
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:43,844
Go!

1337
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:53,506
Okay, everybody,
the tournament has begun!

1338
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,595
[cheering]

1339
01:23:58,424 --> 01:23:59,556
Welcome.

1340
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:04,343
Hi, thank you so much.

1341
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:15,746
Yes!

1342
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:16,964
[grunts]

1343
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:19,271
Agh!

1344
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:24,885
She said it wouldn't work wet.

1345
01:24:24,929 --> 01:24:27,758
Oh, hi. Hi.
Thank you. Welcome.

1346
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:33,677
I know you're still out there.

1347
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:39,813
Come on.

1348
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:42,729
This is for Danny.

1349
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:47,430
And Ron, and everyone else.

1350
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:54,045
[grunting]

1351
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,873
Hey, yes!

1352
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,701
No!

1353
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:15,022
Lisa...

1354
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:23,161
[grunts]

1355
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:06,248
[grunts]

1356
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,866
[shouts]

1357
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,629
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1358
01:26:39,672 --> 01:26:40,847
Hi.

1359
01:26:40,891 --> 01:26:44,068
Hi, hello.

1360
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:45,678
Thanks for signing in.

1361
01:26:45,722 --> 01:26:47,593
Okay.

1362
01:26:47,637 --> 01:26:49,073
Thank you so much.

1363
01:26:54,296 --> 01:26:55,558
[sighs]

1364
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:57,690
[sobbing]

1365
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:08,875
[crying]

1366
01:27:26,066 --> 01:27:28,765
Alan! Alan!

1367
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:32,377
Alan? Oh my God.
Please be alive.

1368
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:33,335
Alan!

1369
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:36,729
Oh, you're breathing.

1370
01:27:36,773 --> 01:27:38,775
Alan, stay with me.
Stay with me.

1371
01:27:38,818 --> 01:27:39,993
Stay with me.

1372
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:41,212
Alan!
Breathe!

1373
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,170
[coughing]

1374
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:47,436
Lisa?

1375
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:49,089
Lisa! You're okay!

1376
01:27:57,446 --> 01:27:58,751
Did Ron make it?

1377
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:03,756
I'm sorry.

1378
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:16,203
[sobbing]

1379
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:17,727
But...

1380
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:19,903
It's over.

1381
01:28:22,035 --> 01:28:23,167
You mean?

1382
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,908
It's over. The shark is dead.

1383
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:26,518
[laughing]

1384
01:28:26,562 --> 01:28:27,867
It's over?

1385
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:29,129
My God, it's over?

1386
01:29:06,863 --> 01:29:09,735
Well, finishing up
the blueprints

1387
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:11,607
for the new addition.

1388
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,522
We're going to open the
bar wide up.

1389
01:29:13,565 --> 01:29:17,047
After you graduate,
Mr. Architect,

1390
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:19,963
I can't have you knocking down
any load-bearing walls.

1391
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:21,530
You know what?

1392
01:29:21,573 --> 01:29:23,358
No matter how hard you try,

1393
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:25,534
you'll never roll
silverware as fast as me.

1394
01:29:25,577 --> 01:29:27,405
Is that a challenge?

1395
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:29,712
Then it's on when we get back.

1396
01:29:31,191 --> 01:29:32,584
Here we go.

1397
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:35,674
Hey, guys.

1398
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:37,284
Jerry.

1399
01:29:37,328 --> 01:29:38,547
Jerry, what are you doing here?

1400
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:41,593
Well, I'm proud
to report

1401
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:44,683
the repairs to the dam
are almost complete.

1402
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:46,990
Triple-reinforced,
the whole works.

1403
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:48,731
Thing looks entirely different.

1404
01:29:48,774 --> 01:29:50,646
This is a brand new dam.

1405
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:56,086
Well, that's wonderful, Jerry,
but why are you telling us?

1406
01:29:56,129 --> 01:29:59,829
Well, with a brand new dam,

1407
01:29:59,872 --> 01:30:02,005
we figured we could
use a new name.

1408
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:09,534
What do you think?

1409
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:16,759
You're naming the
dam after Danny?

1410
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:19,109
Well, we felt it fitting.

1411
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:22,504
We? Who's...

1412
01:30:31,904 --> 01:30:33,471
Jerry, it's...

1413
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:36,561
It's perfect.

1414
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:39,782
Thank you.

1415
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:44,482
Well, I'm going to leave
you guys to it.

1416
01:30:44,526 --> 01:30:46,179
Enjoy that beautiful sunset.

1417
01:30:46,223 --> 01:30:47,267
-Thanks, Jerry.
-We will.

1418
01:30:55,493 --> 01:30:57,452
-I love you.
-I love you, too.
