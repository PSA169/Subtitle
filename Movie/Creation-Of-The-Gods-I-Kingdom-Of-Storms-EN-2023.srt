Adapted from the Ming novel, The Investiture of the Gods,
and the Song/Yuan script, King Zhou's Attack of the Shang

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,700
At the beginning of time, the world was shapeless.

5
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,950
Separating the sky and earth,

6
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,700
Pangu turned his body into the sun, the moon, the mountains
and the rivers,

7
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,991
and the world was thus created.

8
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,908
Nuwa made figurines out of clay,

9
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,616
imparting her own spirit to give them life,

10
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,616
and humans were thus created.

11
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,616
Before she died, Nuwa left behind a sacred artifact,

12
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:07,408
called the “Fengshen Bang”,

13
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,866
and appointed the Immortals of Kunlun to guard it.

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,825
It had the power to save the world...

15
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:18,075
...and could only be opened by the King of All Realms.

16
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,575
As the generations came and went,

17
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,950
Cheng Tang established the Shang Dynasty.

18
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,200
The Four Dukes of the East, West, South and North,

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,408
together with the 800 Lords under them,

20
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:34,450
acknowledged the Shang monarch as the King of All Realms.

21
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,533
But there came a time,

22
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,575
500 years into the reign of the Shang,

23
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:43,741
Su Hu, Lord of Jizhou, refused to submit his tribute...

24
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,283
...and rebelled against the Shang‘s King Yi.

25
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,575
After a long and bitter siege,

26
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:55,575
King Yi sent his second son, Yin Shou, into battle.

27
00:02:56,658 --> 00:03:03,366
Yin Shou led a special force trained by his own hand.

28
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,991
I am Ji Fa, son of Ji Chang, Duke of the West.

29
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:35,700
Riding by my side is my best friend, Yin Jiao.

30
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,658
His father is our commander and hero.

31
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,658
One day I hope to become just like him.

32
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,450
State your name.

33
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,200
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu,

34
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,450
Lord of Jizhou.

35
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:13,158
Louder, so they can hear you.

36
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,241
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu,

37
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,283
Lord of Jizhou.

38
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,408
State your rank.

39
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,408
Centurion of the Shang Hostage Brigade,

40
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,033
North Battalion.

41
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,991
Tell us why you’re a “hostage”.

42
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,408
The 800 Lords...

43
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:36,325
...of the East, West, South and North are required to send
one of their sons...

44
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,866
...to be hostages of the Shang court.

45
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:40,283
If any Lord plots against the King,

46
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:42,325
his hostage son is to be executed first,

47
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,575
followed by his entire family.

48
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:49,075
Your father Su Hu has led Jizhou in rebellion.

49
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,616
Go talk some sense into him.

50
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:13,616
Father! Please surrender!

51
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,866
I’ve been away for eight years.

52
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,450
I’ve grown up.

53
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,575
My father doesn't recognize me.

54
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,866
That man doesn't deserve to be your father.

55
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,908
You are my son.

56
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:34,158
And now, you have to be my bravest son.

57
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,825
Farewell,

58
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:51,450
Father!

59
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,491
Just now,

60
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,575
right before your eyes,

61
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,825
one of your brothers died!

62
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,783
One of my sons died!

63
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:31,616
Who killed him?

64
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:33,616
The traitor Su Hu!

65
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,575
Who was it that killed him?

66
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:37,116
The traitor Su Hu!

67
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,575
Who was it that killed him?

68
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,158
The traitor Su Hu!

69
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,075
The traitor Su Hu!

70
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,075
The traitor Su Hu!

71
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:45,950
Fire!

72
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,366
Warriors of Shang...

73
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,408
annihilate Jizhou!

74
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:42,950
Annihilate Jizhou!

75
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:49,241
Attack!

76
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,283
Ji Fa, come on!

77
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:55,116
Watch out!

78
00:09:59,075 --> 00:09:59,908
Attack!

79
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,075
Fire!

80
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,200
Attack!

81
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,116
Into the breach!

82
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,241
Attack!

83
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,158
Make way!

84
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:36,950
Ji Fa!

85
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,075
Ji Fa!

86
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:49,450
Yin Jiao,

87
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,325
you retreated in fear.

88
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,408
You’re such a disappointment.

89
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:53,450
Forgive me, Father!

90
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,825
Sir,

91
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:56,408
It wasn’t us!

92
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,116
The horses bolted when they saw the fire.

93
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,866
Father!

94
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,950
The horses see what we allow them to see!

95
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,241
Faster!

96
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,991
Attack!

97
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,741
Attack!

98
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,116
Attack!

99
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:39,658
Attack!

100
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,741
Attack!

101
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,491
After the city was taken, we chased the Su family...

102
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,408
...all the way to the Xuanyuan Tomb.

103
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,200
We were determined to chop off Su Hu's head...

104
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,825
...to avenge his son, Su Quanxiao.

105
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:15,575
Brother!

106
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:16,408
Brother!

107
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,283
Brother!

108
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,241
Never forget...

109
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,616
the Su family will never submit to the Shang King!

110
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:11,200
Father.

111
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,825
Run!

112
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,116
Watch out.

113
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,283
A woman.

114
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:03,325
Who is she?

115
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:05,700
Su Hu's daughter,

116
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:07,283
Su Daji.

117
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,533
The daughter of a traitor...

118
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,033
...must be put to death.

119
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,283
Ji Fa,

120
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:17,616
kill her.

121
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:18,450
Huh?

122
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,533
Kill a woman?

123
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,033
I can't.

124
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:25,908
Jiang Wenhuan,

125
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:27,283
you do it.

126
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:28,158
E Shun,

127
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:29,283
you do it.

128
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,116
Why don't you do it?

129
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,616
My hairpin...

130
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:48,825
Ji Fa!

131
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,491
Ji Fa!

132
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:10,950
It would be a waste...

133
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,200
...to kill a girl like that.

134
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,575
Let's give her to the Commander.

135
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,575
You losers!

136
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,241
I'll do it.

137
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:19,866
Yin Jiao!

138
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:20,741
Yin Jiao!

139
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:28,908
Sir!

140
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:30,700
Sir!

141
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:31,616
Sir!

142
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,950
A toast to us! Warriors...

143
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:51,075
...of the Shang Dynasty!

144
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:52,908
Hear, hear.

145
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,325
I want to make a toast...

146
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,866
...to our brother,

147
00:18:58,408 --> 00:18:59,200
Su Quanxiao.

148
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,158
To our brother.

149
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:01,866
To our brother.

150
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,533
The son of the traitor Su Hu...

151
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,991
...doesn’t deserve to be our brother.

152
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,283
Father and son are not always the same.

153
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,533
His father may have been a traitor,

154
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,283
but Su Quanxiao did nothing wrong.

155
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:15,450
Like father, like son.

156
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:18,241
Your father, Ji Chang, Duke of the West,

157
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,575
knows nothing but plowing the fields.

158
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,616
Even in that armor, Ji Fa,

159
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,700
you're still just a farmer from Xiqi,

160
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:27,658
reeking of manure.

161
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:30,783
Let's drink.

162
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:33,825
Your father, Chong Houhu, Duke of the North,

163
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:37,533
knows nothing but hunting animals.

164
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,033
Even in that armor,

165
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:41,491
you're still...

166
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,241
...just a hunter,

167
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,783
reeking of... what?

168
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,866
What does he smell like?

169
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,408
A beast.

170
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:58,116
I know what you want.

171
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,700
You want to be...

172
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:24,283
...King of All The World.

173
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:39,366
You know what happens to the daughters of traitors?

174
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,575
At dawn, you'll be offered as a sacrifice to our banner.

175
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,533
I'm different from the others.

176
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,658
I can help you.

177
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:32,325
After being a hostage in Zhaoge for eight years,

178
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:34,283
on this day,

179
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:37,325
I finally return as a hero...

180
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:40,991
...to the welcoming cheers of the entire city.

181
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:31,491
I, Yin Shou, bow to His Majesty and His Highness.

182
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,075
To you, Father, I present Su Hu’s head.

183
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:55,950
And to you, Brother, the battle flag of Jizhou.

184
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,700
Su Hu,

185
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:08,950
you once declared you’d never bow to me,

186
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,700
and yet, here you are.

187
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,283
At the victory banquet tomorrow,

188
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,075
we’ll use his skull as a goblet...

189
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,700
...and drink from it until daybreak!

190
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:24,783
King of Shang, King of All Realms!

191
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:28,408
The Hostage Brigade, returning in victory,

192
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,991
will perform a war dance for His Majesty.

193
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,200
Attack!

194
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,658
Long live Your Majesty!

195
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,033
My son...

196
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,533
...my dearest son dances for me!

197
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,908
Excellent!

198
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:54,658
Encircle him!

199
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:57,533
Shields!

200
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:40,700
Your Highness...

201
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:48,700
He's dead!

202
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:50,825
Ji Fa,

203
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:53,908
you killed the Prince.

204
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,408
Your entire family will be executed.

205
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,533
Ji Fa.

206
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,533
Killing the Prince is a serious crime,

207
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,616
and the penalty is death.

208
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:04,950
What a horrific crime!

209
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,991
Father!

210
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:38,325
My brother Yin Qi killed our father, the King.

211
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:42,908
Ji Fa,

212
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,075
what you did was not only justified,

213
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:55,575
but a service to our kingdom.

214
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,950
If Yin Jiao hadn’t spoken for me...

215
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,866
...and the Commander hadn’t shown mercy,

216
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,783
my whole family would have been executed.

217
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:42,158
But now that the King is dead,

218
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,741
what would become of the Shang dynasty?

219
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:10,866
So this is why the Supreme One summoned the twelve of us...

220
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:12,950
...here to the Yuxu Palace.

221
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:15,075
The mortal world is in misery.

222
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:17,491
Is this the future of all humanity?

223
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,783
This is the Great Curse. Tell us, Supreme One,

224
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,533
what have the mortals done to deserve this?

225
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,866
When wars are raging

226
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,116
and demons become rampant,

227
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:30,491
The Great Curse is sure to fall upon all.

228
00:29:31,158 --> 00:29:31,908
In the beginning,

229
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,116
when Pangu broke through the chaos,

230
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,575
the pure Qi rose to form the sky...

231
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,241
...and the impure descended to form the earth.

232
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,325
The sky and earth were thus created,

233
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,033
and life flourished.

234
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,825
The Great Curse will cause...

235
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,491
...everything to be reversed.

236
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,491
The world is falling back into chaos...

237
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:51,533
...and all life will be extinguished.

238
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:54,908
Although the mortals probably deserve it,

239
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:58,408
we can't just sit here and do nothing.

240
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:01,283
Lady Nuwa left the Fengshen Bang...

241
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:02,741
...here in Kunlun, under our guard...

242
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:05,658
...precisely because she foresaw this day.

243
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,533
It is time for the Fengshen Bang to be delivered unto the world.

244
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:13,491
As soon as the Fengshen Bang is placed into the hands...

245
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,075
...of the King of All Realms,

246
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,491
and he unseals it and invests the new gods,

247
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:19,533
the Great Curse will be lifted...

248
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,325
...and humanity will be saved.

249
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:23,741
I'm sure you're all aware of the price one must pay...

250
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,033
...to be the bearer of the Fengshen Bang.

251
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,825
Supreme One, allow me.

252
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:30,908
It should be me this time.

253
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,783
I’ll do it.

254
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:34,325
I should be the one.

255
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:37,616
There’s no room for error.

256
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,033
We must let the Supreme One decide...

257
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,075
...who the bearer shall be.

258
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,116
Humanity is in dire peril.

259
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,700
I’ll deliver the Fengshen Bang to them.

260
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:26,450
Ziya,

261
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:28,658
you must be aware that,

262
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:32,075
when an Immortal touches the Fengshen Bang,

263
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,741
they will lose all their powers,

264
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,116
become mortal again,

265
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:38,450
and, therefore, never return to Kunlun.

266
00:31:40,825 --> 00:31:42,991
All the more reason I should be the one.

267
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:47,950
And why is that?

268
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,241
All of you have been practising for more than a thousand years...

269
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,033
...to achieve your current powers.

270
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:55,533
That mustn’t be squandered.

271
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,033
I've only been practising for forty years.

272
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,200
It's no great tragedy...

273
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,741
...to lose the powers I have.

274
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:02,825
And, before I took up practising,

275
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,158
I was a merchant.

276
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:05,408
I traveled quite often...

277
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:07,366
...and had a lot of worldly experiences.

278
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,075
I humbly volunteer...

279
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:11,866
...to take on this task.

280
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:15,283
Ziya, you haven't been with us for long,

281
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,908
and you're not yet able...

282
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:19,116
...to see visions of the future,

283
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:21,491
which is why I did not summon you today.

284
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:24,700
And yet, your intrusion, driven by your sympathy...

285
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,325
...for the mortals,

286
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,366
disrupted our vision of the Great Curse.

287
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:34,116
Could this be your destiny?

288
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,241
Jiang Ziya,

289
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,491
are you really ready to give up...

290
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,200
...forty years of immortality and power...

291
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:18,825
...and go back to being a mortal?

292
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:14,200
The Great Black Bird...

293
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,950
...gave birth to the Shang people.

294
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,616
Ancestors, hear me!

295
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:28,491
I, Yin Shou, never desired to be King,

296
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,825
but the country must have a ruler,

297
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:35,116
and I, being my father's only living child,

298
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,075
have no choice but to ascend the throne...

299
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,491
...and sustain the Shang dynasty.

300
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:41,658
I now implore my uncle, High Priest Bi Gan...

301
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,033
...to see into our kingdom’s future.

302
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:52,866
The dynasty is doomed!

303
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,075
The dynasty is doomed!

304
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:55,033
The dynasty is doomed!

305
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:56,033
The dynasty is doomed!

306
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,366
The dynasty is doomed!

307
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,700
The dynasty is doomed!

308
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,116
Uncle, what are you saying?

309
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,366
The Gods foretold our doom...

310
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:23,616
...by shattering our divination.

311
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:25,325
What have we done to deserve a curse like that?

312
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,366
A member of our royal family...

313
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:30,533
...killed his own father and King.

314
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:34,283
No greater sin could have been committed,

315
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:37,866
the gods have been enraged.

316
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,158
We descendants of Cheng Tang...

317
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,366
...are no longer fit to be King of All Realms.

318
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:46,033
I will sacrifice a hundred human lives...

319
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,908
...to quell their rage.

320
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:48,991
It’s useless.

321
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:50,491
One thousand, then.

322
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:54,241
Even ten thousand won't help.

323
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:55,825
Back in the beginning,

324
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,825
when our ancestor Cheng Tang united the land,

325
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,825
so many lives were taken that a Great Curse fell.

326
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:08,033
A great drought of seven years...

327
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:10,825
...left the land completely barren.

328
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:16,158
By building and mounting a sacrificial pyre...

329
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:17,491
...and immolating himself,

330
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:22,408
Cheng Tang finally moved the Gods and lifted the curse.

331
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:26,491
Are you suggesting I should do the same?

332
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:28,325
How dare you, Bi Gan!

333
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,658
My father only just ascended the throne...

334
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,658
...and you want him to sacrifice himself!

335
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,991
The very idea...

336
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:42,741
...is treason!

337
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,033
You fool!

338
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,241
The Great Curse is just beginning.

339
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:48,033
Before long,

340
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,450
our people will be in misery...

341
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,075
...and our ancestors will be without offerings.

342
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:53,033
When that time comes,

343
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:56,491
the entire Shang dynasty will be no more!

344
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,616
Father, pass the throne to me.

345
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,575
I will sacrifice myself in your place.

346
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,783
What is a king...

347
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,325
...if not the bearer of all earthly sins?

348
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,700
I will follow our ancestor Cheng Tang’s example...

349
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,158
...and build a sacrificial pyre in Zhaoge.

350
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,075
On the day it is completed,

351
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:31,450
I will burn myself as sacrifice to save the kingdom.

352
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,616
Blessed is the kingdom!

353
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,283
Kneel!

354
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:43,825
Blessed is the kingdom!

355
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,866
Blessed is the kingdom!

356
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,783
Blessed is the kingdom!

357
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:50,908
Kowtow!

358
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,825
I waited outside the Deer Terrace for an hour,

359
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:09,075
but His Majesty...

360
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:11,533
...refused to see me.

361
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,241
I'll go fetch him.

362
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,991
You spoke out of turn today.

363
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,741
You’ve aroused your father’s mistrust.

364
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,075
I asked him to pass the throne to me...

365
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,575
...so I could die in his place.

366
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:32,408
Surely he must know that.

367
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:37,658
You don't know your father.

368
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,741
Mother,

369
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,866
you worry too much.

370
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:45,658
I will bring Father here,

371
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,950
so our family can be together.

372
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:04,866
Ji Fa.

373
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:05,700
Yin Jiao.

374
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:07,116
It's a fox demon.

375
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,450
Follow me.

376
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,908
Are you sure it went this way?

377
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,158
There, in the Celestial Chamber.

378
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:40,200
His Majesty is resting,

379
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:42,033
and no one is allowed to enter.

380
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:44,450
My father is in danger.

381
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,075
I don't have time for this!

382
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:18,991
Who's there?

383
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:21,575
Father,

384
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:23,075
it's me.

385
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,658
Barging in at this hour, carrying a sword!

386
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,325
Aren't you in a hurry...

387
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:30,200
...to sit on my throne!

388
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,283
I would never!

389
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,908
I was chasing a fox...

390
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,325
...demon.

391
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:37,158
We barged in here out of concern...

392
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,700
...for Your Majesty's safety. Please forgive us.

393
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:40,950
What fox demon?

394
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,200
What's she doing here?

395
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:45,200
Get out!

396
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:46,825
At once, Your Majesty!

397
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:57,866
I should have killed her when we first saw her!

398
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:01,116
His Majesty is sacrificing himself to save the world.

399
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,325
He is a hero.

400
00:43:06,408 --> 00:43:07,950
Don't upset him again.

401
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,783
If it were your father,

402
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,616
what would you do?

403
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:25,241
I've been away for eight years.

404
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:27,950
My own father...

405
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:31,491
...probably wouldn't even recognize me anymore.

406
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:56,075
I'm afraid we'll have a bad harvest this year.

407
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,866
With the Great Curse upon Zhaoge,

408
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:06,283
even Xiqi is affected.

409
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,616
Thanks to your precautions, Father,

410
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,866
we have enough food stored...

411
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:12,575
...for the next three years.

412
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,533
What about after that?

413
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:28,200
In the course of one night,

414
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:31,241
the King and the Prince were both killed.

415
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:32,616
Most strange,

416
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,075
the new King should be so hasty to ascend the throne,

417
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:39,908
and then immediately summon the Four Dukes,

418
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:41,783
with dark intentions, I think.

419
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:43,533
This trip to Zhaoge...

420
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,283
...could be most treacherous.

421
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:46,866
Please reconsider, Father.

422
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,783
My Lord.

423
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:54,408
If I disobey the King, war will ensue...

424
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:58,325
...and the entire country will pay the price.

425
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:04,450
Although the throne has changed hands,

426
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:08,533
my duties remain the same.

427
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:16,491
Let's take this chance to visit Ji Fa.

428
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:19,158
It's been eight years.

429
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,908
He must be as tall as you now.

430
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:25,950
Maybe even taller.

431
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:36,033
When I'm gone, you're the guardian of Xiqi,

432
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,408
and you must keep it safe.

433
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,491
No matter what happens,

434
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:44,908
don't leave Xiqi.

435
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:49,950
Safe return, Father.

436
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:18,366
Line up. Line up.

437
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:19,575
Let them through.

438
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:21,325
Stop pushing.

439
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,241
Stop them.

440
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:24,241
Stop pushing.

441
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,700
Stay back, you lot!

442
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:28,616
Your pass.

443
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:29,908
No pass, no entry.

444
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:31,991
We need a pass?

445
00:46:32,741 --> 00:46:33,866
What a nuisance.

446
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:34,575
Master Ziya,

447
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:36,408
let me fly you in on my Fire Wheels.

448
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:39,741
My Five Elements Teleportation is faster.

449
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:42,408
No. When we set out, the Supreme One told us...

450
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,408
...to refrain from using our powers.

451
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,991
But the mortal world has its own tricks.

452
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:51,616
Watch this.

453
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:58,075
Good day, sir.

454
00:46:58,783 --> 00:46:59,825
Who are you?

455
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:06,033
We are immortals, all the way from Kunlun.

456
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,783
So we have no pass.

457
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:10,533
No pass?

458
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,908
But, we have this.

459
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,408
Take it.

460
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:25,700
What is this?

461
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,700
Elixir.

462
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:30,408
What does it do?

463
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:31,908
What does it do?!

464
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:35,700
This elixir contains pure Qi,

465
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,241
the essence of water,

466
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,991
the blessing of benevolent gods,

467
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:44,033
and the best of Sky, Earth and Man.

468
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:45,200
One whiff.

469
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:46,658
And you'll feel refreshed.

470
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:47,825
One taste.

471
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:49,783
And all discomfort is gone.

472
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:54,325
Such an amazing elixir can't be bought...

473
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:57,616
...no matter how much you're ready to offer.

474
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,325
Consider it our gift...

475
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,450
...to you, our new friend.

476
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:06,075
Master Ziya, your mortal trick worked!

477
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:07,741
Come along,

478
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:09,283
I'll take good care of you.

479
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:10,033
You're too kind.

480
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:12,158
I'll drive you into the city myself.

481
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:16,283
Must His Majesty sacrifice himself...

482
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:20,325
...on the pyre to dispel the Great Curse?

483
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,158
Maybe...

484
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,491
...only the gods know the answer.

485
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:40,866
We're here.

486
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:41,825
Get off.

487
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:43,116
Keep up.

488
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:44,200
Hurry.

489
00:49:09,075 --> 00:49:09,658
Master Ziya.

490
00:49:56,241 --> 00:49:58,575
Master Ziya, what's going on?

491
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,450
Looks like...

492
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:06,783
...we've been sold.

493
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:07,700
Sold?

494
00:50:07,783 --> 00:50:10,700
I thought you knew your way around here.

495
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:14,283
I haven't been back in forty years.

496
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:16,658
It wasn’t like this before.

497
00:50:17,158 --> 00:50:18,575
Bring them over.

498
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:21,116
Sir,

499
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,408
we have something for His Majesty.

500
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,783
Cut the crap.

501
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:47,616
That's about enough.

502
00:50:56,908 --> 00:50:57,491
Oh no.

503
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:14,950
Look!

504
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,158
Thunderbolts!

505
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:22,700
Go and save those people!

506
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:23,950
Can we use our powers?

507
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,658
Of course.

508
00:51:25,575 --> 00:51:26,991
Finally!

509
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:13,533
So the Gods really do exist!

510
00:52:14,283 --> 00:52:15,325
There’s hope for His Majesty!

511
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:23,450
The alchemist Shen Gongbao from Golden Turtle Island...

512
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,283
...is here to demonstrate his powers for His Majesty.

513
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,491
The honor is mine.

514
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:55,116
Fascinating.

515
00:52:55,783 --> 00:52:56,825
What sorcery is this?

516
00:52:57,116 --> 00:52:58,158
Your Majesty,

517
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,366
With this spell I can survive beheading.

518
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,783
How about burning?

519
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:07,616
If one is able to live without his head,

520
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,241
a little fire is nothing to worry about.

521
00:53:11,908 --> 00:53:14,616
Perfect. How long does it take to master it?

522
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:19,116
It took me a thousand years,

523
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:22,575
but, with Your Majesty's extraordinary talents,

524
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,950
500 years should be enough.

525
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:28,200
500 years?

526
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:29,366
That's right.

527
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:31,741
Ludicrous!

528
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,783
That hurts.

529
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:36,825
No!

530
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:37,658
Don't.

531
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,241
Here. Here.

532
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:42,575
Over here.

533
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,075
Hurry it up!

534
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:48,158
Jiang Ziya, Taoist Monk from Kunlun,

535
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,700
has something to present to His Majesty.

536
00:53:59,616 --> 00:54:00,658
What is it?

537
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,491
What I have here...

538
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,533
...is the Fengshen Bang.

539
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:10,658
What does it do?

540
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,241
A great turmoil is on the horizon.

541
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:18,283
I was sent by my master, the Supreme One, to bring the
Fengshen Bang...

542
00:54:18,741 --> 00:54:21,616
...to the King of All Realms.

543
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:26,491
When the King unseals it and invests the new gods,

544
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,825
the Fengshen Bang will dispel the Great Curse...

545
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,408
...and all of humanity will be saved.

546
00:54:35,158 --> 00:54:37,116
Can such a small scroll...

547
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:38,908
...really remove the Great Curse?

548
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,158
More than that!

549
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,158
The Fengshen Bang is a sacred artifact left behind by the
Lady Nuwa.

550
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:57,908
It absorbs the Qi energy of the dead,

551
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:02,825
or what we may call “souls”.

552
00:55:02,991 --> 00:55:06,200
Once Your Majesty unseals the Fengshen Bang...

553
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:09,616
all this energy will be yours...

554
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:13,200
...to command.

555
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:14,908
That means,

556
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,991
the more people die,

557
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:19,325
the more powerful the Fengshen Bang becomes?

558
00:55:19,408 --> 00:55:21,575
Your Majesty is insightful.

559
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:25,283
So the Great Curse may in fact be a blessing.

560
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:27,116
Your Majesty is all-knowing.

561
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,700
This sorcerer is a demon.

562
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:30,700
Well, then...

563
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,575
...we’ll share in the rewards!

564
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:33,658
Hang on.

565
00:55:34,783 --> 00:55:36,908
The authenticity...

566
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,241
...of the Fengshen Bang...

567
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,366
...is yet to be proven.

568
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,116
How do we do that?

569
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:52,033
I could do it...

570
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:55,283
if I had a freshly-deceased human.

571
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,616
Soul Revelation!

572
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:47,241
Your Majesty is most decisive,

573
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:50,908
but there's something else.

574
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,991
A pattern of steps is needed to unseal the Fengshen Bang.

575
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:57,658
Let me show you.

576
00:56:57,658 --> 00:56:59,075
Watch carefully.

577
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,658
Is this...?

578
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,783
Can it be...

579
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,616
...the Steps of the Cosmos?

580
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,866
Not so fast, my Taoist Brother.

581
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:36,950
Run!

582
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:38,116
Stop them!

583
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:49,241
Don't kill anyone!

584
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:50,158
Got it!

585
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:18,200
Easy! Easy!

586
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,325
Master Ziya!

587
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:50,158
Yin Jiao! Ji Fa! Get the Fengshen Bang!

588
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:55,658
Come on!

589
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,241
Out of my way!

590
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:00,658
Go after them!

591
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:29,491
Water Teleportation!

592
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:58,408
Ji Fa, you go that way!

593
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,783
It's dangerous! Stop!

594
01:00:35,408 --> 01:00:36,283
You stop!

595
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,116
It's a dead end.

596
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,158
If you come closer,

597
01:00:39,575 --> 01:00:40,866
I'll jump.

598
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,366
You’ve come all this way,

599
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:43,825
why change your mind now?

600
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:45,700
Just pretend I was never here.

601
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,783
That solves everything, doesn't it?

602
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,700
Go back! Go back!

603
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:52,325
The Fengshen Bang belongs to the King of All Realms,

604
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:53,783
and that King is my father.

605
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,450
What right do you have to keep it?

606
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,200
I was going to give it to him,

607
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,200
but I can't now.

608
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,075
You despicable cheat.

609
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:05,533
Tell me,

610
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,950
what does it mean to be King of All Realms?

611
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:10,116
If he can slaughter...

612
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:11,908
...an innocent man,

613
01:01:11,908 --> 01:01:15,075
how can he be trusted with all of humanity?

614
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:16,616
My father is willing...

615
01:01:16,616 --> 01:01:17,908
The Great Curse is coming,

616
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,991
and countless lives will be lost every day.

617
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,533
Yet he called this a blessing!

618
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:26,325
Tell me.

619
01:01:26,741 --> 01:01:28,075
If you were King,

620
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
would you do the same?

621
01:01:29,283 --> 01:01:30,033
Shut up!

622
01:01:31,366 --> 01:01:33,325
Return the Fengshen Bang to my father!

623
01:02:07,325 --> 01:02:10,158
Old Man, hand over the Fengshen Bang.

624
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,075
Without it, His Majesty will die.

625
01:02:13,783 --> 01:02:15,158
If I give it to him,

626
01:02:16,116 --> 01:02:18,991
I'm afraid the rest of the world will meet that same fate.

627
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:20,450
Nonsense!

628
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,491
His Majesty is a hero!

629
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,908
But he takes you as fools.

630
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:30,033
He doesn't care about anyone else.

631
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,658
He cares only about himself.

632
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,200
Yin Jiao.

633
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:38,616
Yin Jiao,

634
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:40,116
he just saved your life.

635
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:40,991
I don't care.

636
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,866
I need to save my father.

637
01:02:57,366 --> 01:02:58,491
Master Ziya!

638
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,033
Don't hurt him. Don't!

639
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:19,033
Where is my Fengshen Bang?

640
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,533
Release him!

641
01:03:24,825 --> 01:03:25,491
Ji Fa,

642
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:26,741
take the Fengshen Bang and run!

643
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,158
Don't do it. Don't do it.

644
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,033
You wouldn't dare.

645
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:31,075
Don't let go!

646
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,533
Don't do it!

647
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:38,366
He let go.

648
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,658
Thunderbolts!

649
01:03:46,575 --> 01:03:47,950
He actually jumped!

650
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:05,033
Yin Jiao.

651
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,741
Master,

652
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:10,616
I have something important to report to you.

653
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,241
It’s the Fengshen Bang.

654
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,575
I actually saw the Fengshen Bang.

655
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:19,366
If you saw the Fengshen Bang,

656
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:22,033
why didn't you bring it to me?

657
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:24,700
Forgive me, Master.

658
01:05:26,325 --> 01:05:27,825
It's not that I didn't try,

659
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:32,200
but the Kunlun monk had lots of backup.

660
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:34,116
I was...

661
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:36,908
What Kunlun monk?

662
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:40,908
How dare he bully you?

663
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,325
Master, let's go teach them a lesson!

664
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:51,075
This spell is for “Soul Instillation”.

665
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:53,783
Our Master is good to you.

666
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:56,158
What are you waiting for? Go!

667
01:05:56,783 --> 01:05:58,158
Thank you, Master.

668
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:29,783
Master Ziya.

669
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:32,533
You're awake.

670
01:06:33,116 --> 01:06:34,741
Yin Shou is the King of All Realms,

671
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,075
but you won’t give the Fengshen Bang to him.

672
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,283
What's the point of us staying here?

673
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:41,700
Right! We haven't met anyone nice...

674
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,033
...since we began this journey.

675
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:44,991
You almost lost your life.

676
01:06:46,575 --> 01:06:48,408
Why don’t we take the Fengshen Bang back to Kunlun...

677
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,700
...and leave these mortals to their own devices?

678
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,741
Yin Jiao is the Crown Prince.

679
01:06:55,741 --> 01:06:58,533
He is the next King of All Realms.

680
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,866
He’s not like his father.

681
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:06,533
Yin Jiao? How long do we have to wait...

682
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:08,325
...for him to become King?

683
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:13,950
Who said anything about waiting?

684
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,491
Could it be another demon?

685
01:07:33,408 --> 01:07:34,533
Stop.

686
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:55,658
Where did this baby come from?

687
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,200
So strange. Must be a demon.

688
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:04,908
My Lord, be careful.

689
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:37,491
A pitiful thing, all alone.

690
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:49,700
Sir,

691
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:52,991
that thing in your arms might be a demon.

692
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:56,700
Better to kill it now,

693
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,783
before it becomes a threat.

694
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:05,200
If you can't do it, we will.

695
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:07,200
It’s just a child.

696
01:09:09,408 --> 01:09:11,366
Even if he is a demon,

697
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:15,575
whether he grows up to be good or evil...

698
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:19,450
... depends on how he is raised.

699
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:21,950
We can't jump to conclusions.

700
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,325
You are absolutely right.

701
01:09:24,825 --> 01:09:27,366
Nezha, Yang Jian, stay your hands.

702
01:09:28,783 --> 01:09:33,616
I am Jiang Ziya. We come from Kunlun.

703
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:37,283
I am Ji Chang, from Xiqi.

704
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:41,741
The Duke of the West. It's an honor.

705
01:09:49,033 --> 01:09:50,908
The child is frail.

706
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:53,158
To save his life,

707
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:56,283
I propose we send him to Kunlun...

708
01:09:56,283 --> 01:10:00,283
...for my master, the Supreme One, to raise.

709
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:05,658
I've heard a great deal about the Supreme One.

710
01:10:05,866 --> 01:10:10,950
It would be the child’s honor to be taught by him.

711
01:10:12,325 --> 01:10:15,533
Then you should name the child,

712
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,658
so you’ll know him if you meet again.

713
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:24,950
His birth was accompanied by thunder.

714
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,158
Let's name him Lei Zhenzi.

715
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:34,200
Yang Jian, Nezha, take Lei Zhenzi to Kunlun.

716
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,116
Right away.

717
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:49,408
Strange things keep happening these days.

718
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:54,741
Is that why you're going to Zhaoge?

719
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:56,325
We have a new king now.

720
01:10:56,325 --> 01:11:00,575
It's customary for the Four Dukes...

721
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:02,991
...to pay our respects in person.

722
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:05,533
So the other three Dukes are also on their way?

723
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:06,241
Yes.

724
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:15,491
You asked Ji Chang to summon us...

725
01:11:15,491 --> 01:11:19,616
...to dethrone Yin Shou and make Yin Jiao the new King.

726
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:20,950
Exactly.

727
01:11:21,325 --> 01:11:22,575
Yin Shou has promised...

728
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:25,491
...to sacrifice himself to lift the Great Curse.

729
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:26,491
Fool!

730
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,200
You really believe he would burn himself?

731
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,575
When the pyre is built,

732
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:34,158
we'll see if he keeps his word.

733
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:34,533
How can you...

734
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,741
There is no time to lose.

735
01:11:37,116 --> 01:11:40,533
The Great Curse has spread to all realms.

736
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:44,200
Plagues in the North,

737
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:47,116
water turning foul in the East,

738
01:11:47,741 --> 01:11:51,825
babies stillborn in the South,

739
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,575
and crop failure in the West.

740
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:59,366
The longer we wait, the greater the devastation.

741
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:02,491
This curse was brought on by the Yin family.

742
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:04,408
It's their responsibility to end it.

743
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:07,241
The Shang King is the King of All Realms.

744
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,366
The world is his.

745
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,991
This world...

746
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,491
...is not the King's world,

747
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:15,033
but everyone's world.

748
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:15,950
Fascinating...

749
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:20,450
Fascinating...

750
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:26,950
The Duke of the West’s divinations have never been wrong.

751
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,200
So, what does it say?

752
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:31,825
The hexagram indicates “deception”.

753
01:12:32,366 --> 01:12:36,200
The killing of a king was not righteous,

754
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,700
and a throne fell into undeserving hands.

755
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:43,950
So it would seem,

756
01:12:45,325 --> 01:12:52,241
the King was not killed by Yin Qi, but someone else.

757
01:12:53,366 --> 01:12:54,866
Who would that be?

758
01:12:54,866 --> 01:12:58,616
Who else but Yin Shou?

759
01:12:58,616 --> 01:13:01,575
It's not right to jump to such conclusions.

760
01:13:05,991 --> 01:13:08,033
Are you with us or not?

761
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:09,450
It's treason,

762
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:14,158
with little chance of success.

763
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,241
How about you, Ji Chang?

764
01:13:21,575 --> 01:13:28,491
Don't forget our sons are kept as hostages in Zhaoge.

765
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,908
So be it.

766
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:36,991
So be it!

767
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:39,241
I'll return to the south and rally my troops.

768
01:13:39,325 --> 01:13:42,450
I can do this without you.

769
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:45,283
Stop! Nobody move!

770
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,783
You dare to plot treason!

771
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:55,783
He's alone. Kill him.

772
01:13:55,783 --> 01:13:57,825
No!

773
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,158
It's my son, Ji Fa.

774
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,491
I am Ji Fa, a guard of the royal court.

775
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:12,658
I saw Yin Qi kill his father with my own eyes,

776
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,783
and yet you try to smear His Majesty...

777
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,491
...with these false divinations!

778
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,366
Do you see?

779
01:14:19,575 --> 01:14:21,533
He's been a hostage so long...

780
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,991
...that he takes Yin Shou to be his father.

781
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:26,616
What good is a son like that?

782
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:28,283
Kill him.

783
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:40,575
You’re not getting away!

784
01:14:45,616 --> 01:14:46,950
Ji Fa! We finally found you. -Brethren!

785
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:49,158
We are the royal guards. Drop your weapons!

786
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:50,575
Step aside!

787
01:14:58,116 --> 01:14:59,825
They say you can see the future.

788
01:15:00,575 --> 01:15:01,450
Ji Chang,

789
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,408
are you able to see...

790
01:15:05,408 --> 01:15:06,866
...your own death?

791
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:10,033
Your Majesty,

792
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:12,491
a fortune teller...

793
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:15,366
...can see the future...

794
01:15:15,366 --> 01:15:17,366
...of everything...

795
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:18,908
...except for...

796
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,741
...his own fortunes.

797
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,450
What do you see now?

798
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:26,533
It shows here that,

799
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:29,075
Your Majesty,

800
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,658
will die by the hand of your own flesh and blood.

801
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,950
Everyone knows that...

802
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,450
...I intend to sacrifice myself...

803
01:15:47,658 --> 01:15:49,533
...to save the world.

804
01:15:49,575 --> 01:15:50,533
Ji Chang,

805
01:15:51,616 --> 01:15:53,158
you’re nothing but a fake!

806
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,950
Go! Stand before your fathers.

807
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,366
When Yin Qi killed our father,

808
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:09,783
your sons were all there,

809
01:16:10,408 --> 01:16:11,575
they saw everything that happened.

810
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,825
But the four of you...

811
01:16:14,325 --> 01:16:16,533
...would believe baseless rumors...

812
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:19,533
...over what they saw with their own eyes.

813
01:16:20,283 --> 01:16:21,741
You’re not stupid.

814
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:24,950
You’re simply treasonous.

815
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:32,325
Take a good look at these traitors.

816
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:36,200
They used to be your fathers.

817
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:38,033
Now,

818
01:16:38,825 --> 01:16:41,325
they're sinners that betrayed the Shang.

819
01:16:41,825 --> 01:16:43,283
My sister is your wife,

820
01:16:43,616 --> 01:16:45,533
the Queen.

821
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:47,991
The Crown Prince, Yin Jiao, is my nephew.

822
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:50,408
Why would I be a traitor?

823
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:53,866
With the gods as my witnesses,

824
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:55,991
I never intended to betray you.

825
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:57,825
Yin Shou!

826
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,783
You killed your father and your brother,

827
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:03,075
and brought on the Great Curse.

828
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:04,033
You...

829
01:17:04,866 --> 01:17:07,491
...are the sinner.

830
01:17:10,866 --> 01:17:12,075
Your fathers...

831
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:15,575
...kept their favorite sons close to them,

832
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,825
well-fed and well-dressed,

833
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:21,700
waiting to one day inherit...

834
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,366
...their throne.

835
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:26,491
Whereas you...

836
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:30,075
...were abandoned here in distant Zhaoge,

837
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:32,033
to fend for yourselves.

838
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:35,991
And now,

839
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:39,158
you’ve all grown up,

840
01:17:40,408 --> 01:17:43,491
trained by my hand to become Shang warriors.

841
01:17:45,616 --> 01:17:46,991
Your power and courage...

842
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:50,491
...have been forged in mortal combat.

843
01:17:52,283 --> 01:17:54,325
No one can tell you what to do.

844
01:17:56,575 --> 01:17:59,908
You are far stronger than your brothers back home.

845
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:04,241
You are far more qualified to succeed your fathers.

846
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,700
Now, I give you a chance to take what is rightfully yours.

847
01:18:12,783 --> 01:18:15,033
Whoever kills his father...

848
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:20,491
...can take his place.

849
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:28,950
Draw your swords!

850
01:18:51,116 --> 01:18:54,408
Have you forgotten how Su Quanxiao died?

851
01:18:57,991 --> 01:18:59,325
Father!

852
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:02,491
If you don’t kill your father,

853
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:06,533
he will one day kill you.

854
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,575
Father!

855
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:38,075
Good.

856
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:39,241
Chong Yingbiao,

857
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,783
you are now Duke of the North.

858
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:49,908
You fool!

859
01:19:52,658 --> 01:19:54,741
Do it!

860
01:19:58,325 --> 01:19:59,158
No!

861
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,200
No!

862
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:00,950
No!

863
01:20:02,616 --> 01:20:04,158
My son!

864
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:07,741
My son!

865
01:20:26,575 --> 01:20:27,700
You must...

866
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:29,533
...stay alive.

867
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:32,408
Jiang Wenhuan,

868
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,908
you are now Duke of the East.

869
01:20:35,783 --> 01:20:36,616
Father!

870
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:57,700
Ji Fa,

871
01:20:58,158 --> 01:20:59,866
what are you waiting for?

872
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,116
You wish to plead for your father's life?

873
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:10,491
No.

874
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,200
Ji Chang is a traitor...

875
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,075
...who deserves to be executed.

876
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:17,366
The Four Dukes plotted treason...

877
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,241
...because they were misled by Ji Chang.

878
01:21:20,241 --> 01:21:21,616
Ji Chang is the culprit,

879
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:22,866
he started the conspiracy.

880
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:24,241
If we kill him,

881
01:21:24,616 --> 01:21:26,700
his sins will be covered up...

882
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,533
...and no one will know the truth.

883
01:21:32,283 --> 01:21:34,908
He has to apologize in public...

884
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:37,533
...to let the people know that...

885
01:21:38,075 --> 01:21:40,408
...the Four Dukes attempted treason,

886
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:43,325
and it was Your Majesty's decisiveness...

887
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:45,408
...that saved the Shang.

888
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,575
You let the Fengshen Bang get away.

889
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:56,116
That was a failure.

890
01:21:56,991 --> 01:21:59,658
You captured four traitors for the Shang.

891
01:21:59,991 --> 01:22:00,908
That’s to your credit.

892
01:22:02,325 --> 01:22:03,241
Guards!

893
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:09,283
Put Ji Chang in the dungeon.

894
01:22:42,408 --> 01:22:43,325
Father.

895
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:48,491
Father.

896
01:23:05,991 --> 01:23:07,783
That jade circle...

897
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:14,158
...was my gift to you...

898
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:16,866
...when I sent you here to be a hostage.

899
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:20,158
Do you remember what it means?

900
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:22,533
His Majesty promised me that,

901
01:23:22,908 --> 01:23:23,950
as soon as you confess your crime,

902
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:25,408
he will let you go back to Xiqi.

903
01:23:26,283 --> 01:23:27,741
The circle...

904
01:23:28,741 --> 01:23:31,450
...means that one day you will return.

905
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:35,658
It's planting season soon.

906
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:36,783
Xiqi...

907
01:23:36,783 --> 01:23:39,908
Your false prophecies fomented treason.

908
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,366
Why won’t you admit that?

909
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,658
I was wrong.

910
01:23:51,325 --> 01:23:52,658
I shouldn't have...

911
01:23:53,991 --> 01:23:59,950
...sent you to live with such an evil person as Yin Shou.

912
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,158
How can you call him evil?

913
01:24:04,116 --> 01:24:05,575
I saw with my own eyes...

914
01:24:05,575 --> 01:24:07,450
...how he fought for our country.

915
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:09,200
I heard with my own ears...

916
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:11,408
...how he intends to sacrifice himself...

917
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:13,491
...to appease the Great Curse.

918
01:24:14,658 --> 01:24:15,825
As for you,

919
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:17,700
you were in Xiqi.

920
01:24:18,241 --> 01:24:19,616
You didn't witness any of that,

921
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:23,075
and yet you judge him based on a handful of sticks.

922
01:24:24,533 --> 01:24:26,408
It’s ridiculous.

923
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:32,200
My son,

924
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:35,283
what you see...

925
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:41,033
...might only be what Yin Shou wants you to see,

926
01:24:42,616 --> 01:24:44,283
and what you believe...

927
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:49,283
...might only be what Yin Shou wants you to believe.

928
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:56,283
Father.

929
01:25:01,408 --> 01:25:02,866
If...

930
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,325
...you truly believed all that,

931
01:25:07,491 --> 01:25:11,700
you would have killed me yesterday in court.

932
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:19,200
I'm your son.

933
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,075
How could I kill you?

934
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:29,991
Remember,

935
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:34,658
it doesn't matter whose son you are.

936
01:25:36,075 --> 01:25:40,700
What matters is who you are.

937
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:04,366
Such a beautiful body.

938
01:26:06,408 --> 01:26:07,616
To kill it...

939
01:26:08,616 --> 01:26:10,408
...would be a shame, no?

940
01:26:13,116 --> 01:26:14,950
Everything started with you,

941
01:26:16,033 --> 01:26:17,783
perhaps it should end with you as well.

942
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,825
It would appear that...

943
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:27,991
...I’ve awakened a beast.

944
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,575
Keep me around.

945
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:40,408
I know a way for us...

946
01:26:42,325 --> 01:26:47,283
...to share immortality.

947
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:55,533
I ask Your Majesty to execute me.

948
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,491
On what grounds?

949
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,783
Jiang Huanchu, Duke of the East,

950
01:27:02,783 --> 01:27:04,533
was executed by Your Majesty.

951
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,491
As his sister, I deserve the same punishment.

952
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:10,241
You believe he was wronged?

953
01:27:13,283 --> 01:27:15,241
The Four Dukes were loyal men.

954
01:27:16,116 --> 01:27:17,866
By killing them,

955
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
you betrayed the trust of your subjects.

956
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:23,616
Their sons were loving children.

957
01:27:23,616 --> 01:27:25,491
By forcing them to kill their fathers,

958
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,283
you’ve abandoned all morality.

959
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:30,491
What you killed...

960
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:32,616
...was more than four men.

961
01:27:32,616 --> 01:27:34,575
You killed the trust of the world...

962
01:27:34,575 --> 01:27:37,200
...and the Shang reign of the last 500 years.

963
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:39,908
As the Queen...

964
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:42,783
...of this country,

965
01:27:42,783 --> 01:27:45,366
it’s my duty to advise the King.

966
01:27:45,366 --> 01:27:47,491
As your wife,

967
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:50,783
it’s my duty to address your sins.

968
01:27:50,783 --> 01:27:52,783
Perhaps my death can serve to...

969
01:27:52,783 --> 01:27:54,741
...bring you to your senses.

970
01:27:54,991 --> 01:27:56,991
The dead are already gone.

971
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,950
Why waste your own life?

972
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,366
A body such as yours...

973
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:12,950
...is not easy to come by.

974
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:17,991
As Queen,

975
01:28:19,991 --> 01:28:22,033
you deserve to have...

976
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:23,825
...all the joy in the world.

977
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,158
Why don't you join us...

978
01:28:36,325 --> 01:28:38,741
...in our joy?

979
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:45,616
No wonder His Majesty is so fond of you.

980
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:50,241
Even I...

981
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,866
...can’t help feeling drawn to you.

982
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:04,033
Strange that a place as cold and remote as Jizhou...

983
01:30:05,575 --> 01:30:09,575
...was able to produce a stunning beauty like you.

984
01:30:20,741 --> 01:30:21,950
If I were the King,

985
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:25,033
I, too, would fall under your spell.

986
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,283
Evil temptress,

987
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,325
begone from this world!

988
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:35,158
Demon!

989
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:39,366
Your Majesty!

990
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:41,866
So you do intend to kill me!

991
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:43,241
Father!

992
01:32:46,825 --> 01:32:47,366
She’s not human!

993
01:32:47,658 --> 01:32:48,616
She’s a fox demon!

994
01:32:49,033 --> 01:32:50,200
Protect His Majesty!

995
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,491
Guards!

996
01:33:23,658 --> 01:33:24,950
Ji Fa.

997
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:30,741
What should I do?

998
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,283
This leads to outside the Meridian Gate.

999
01:33:38,533 --> 01:33:41,033
Go to High Priest Bi Gan and hide there.

1000
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:45,616
If you let me go,

1001
01:33:46,741 --> 01:33:47,533
what will happen to you?

1002
01:33:49,575 --> 01:33:50,741
Give me the Daemon Duke’s sword.

1003
01:34:03,116 --> 01:34:03,700
Ji Fa.

1004
01:34:08,533 --> 01:34:09,366
Chong Yingbiao,

1005
01:34:10,116 --> 01:34:10,950
it's dark in there.

1006
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,658
I'll find you a torch.

1007
01:34:14,866 --> 01:34:15,658
Bring me...

1008
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:17,491
...a torch!

1009
01:34:27,366 --> 01:34:29,366
The Great Curse is upon us,

1010
01:34:29,366 --> 01:34:30,825
and evildoers are everywhere.

1011
01:34:30,825 --> 01:34:33,533
We are in a time of crisis.

1012
01:34:33,533 --> 01:34:34,950
To make the Great Curse abate,

1013
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:36,575
the evildoers must be rooted out.

1014
01:34:36,575 --> 01:34:39,366
This shows His Majesty's concern for his people.

1015
01:34:39,366 --> 01:34:40,825
The Four Dukes...

1016
01:34:40,825 --> 01:34:42,241
...of the East, West, South and North...

1017
01:34:42,241 --> 01:34:43,866
...were ungrateful traitors...

1018
01:34:43,866 --> 01:34:45,616
...who plotted treason.

1019
01:34:45,616 --> 01:34:47,491
Now that they've failed,

1020
01:34:47,491 --> 01:34:49,116
they are either dead or in prison.

1021
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:50,741
The Queen, Jiang,

1022
01:34:50,741 --> 01:34:52,241
didn't know her place as a woman,

1023
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:53,366
and spoke out of turn.

1024
01:34:53,366 --> 01:34:55,075
Ashamed of what she did,

1025
01:34:55,075 --> 01:34:56,991
she drowned herself. -Kneel before the Duke of The North!

1026
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:58,575
The Crown Prince, Yin Jiao,

1027
01:34:58,575 --> 01:35:00,283
utterly lacking in morals,

1028
01:35:00,283 --> 01:35:01,866
crept into the palace at night...

1029
01:35:01,866 --> 01:35:03,825
...to kill his father and king.

1030
01:35:03,825 --> 01:35:05,783
After he failed, he fled...

1031
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,408
...and is now a wanted man.

1032
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:21,033
This sword of Yin Jiao’s is sharp indeed.

1033
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:34,908
I’ve had my eye on you for days now.

1034
01:35:35,783 --> 01:35:37,408
Where are you hiding Yin Jiao?

1035
01:35:39,075 --> 01:35:40,075
At the stable?

1036
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:41,700
In the barracks?

1037
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,075
Or in a shithole?

1038
01:35:49,283 --> 01:35:50,450
Beast.

1039
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:53,866
Come on.

1040
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:54,783
Bring it on!

1041
01:36:21,616 --> 01:36:22,491
Brother!

1042
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,783
All these years alone here in Zhaoge,

1043
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,325
I’m sure you’ve been bullied a lot.

1044
01:36:31,408 --> 01:36:32,366
No way.

1045
01:36:33,908 --> 01:36:35,325
I do all the bullying!

1046
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:37,908
You’ve always been competitive,

1047
01:36:38,366 --> 01:36:39,950
always wanted to be a great hero.

1048
01:36:40,866 --> 01:36:43,241
I remember when the Shang came for hostages...

1049
01:36:43,908 --> 01:36:46,158
...and Father made us compete in archery...

1050
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:47,533
...to see who would go.

1051
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:49,283
Don’t think for a moment that I don’t know...

1052
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:52,366
...that you tampered with my arrow.

1053
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:53,908
If I hadn’t,

1054
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,075
how could I have beaten you?

1055
01:36:57,075 --> 01:36:58,116
I know that...

1056
01:36:58,575 --> 01:37:01,033
...you wanted more than the quiet life in Xiqi.

1057
01:37:01,658 --> 01:37:04,075
You longed to be a warrior in Zhaoge.

1058
01:37:04,825 --> 01:37:07,033
Now that you're a royal guard,

1059
01:37:07,908 --> 01:37:09,908
I'm really happy for you.

1060
01:37:15,575 --> 01:37:16,408
Brother,

1061
01:37:16,741 --> 01:37:18,241
you are next in line to be Duke of Xiqi.

1062
01:37:18,825 --> 01:37:20,241
You should have stayed there.

1063
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:31,116
The carriages outside are loaded with treasure.

1064
01:37:31,241 --> 01:37:32,158
Tell me...

1065
01:37:33,033 --> 01:37:34,241
...is it enough to save Father?

1066
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:45,908
No amount of treasure will do.

1067
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:54,241
I've already talked to Father,

1068
01:37:56,325 --> 01:37:58,075
but he won't admit he was wrong.

1069
01:37:59,283 --> 01:38:01,366
Father is like that.

1070
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,866
He never does anything...

1071
01:38:06,491 --> 01:38:08,241
...he doesn't believe in.

1072
01:38:10,408 --> 01:38:10,991
Brother,

1073
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:13,908
don't worry.

1074
01:38:14,325 --> 01:38:15,700
I'm working on it.

1075
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,991
I’m afraid that...

1076
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:23,325
...Father is old and frail.

1077
01:38:24,491 --> 01:38:26,200
He can’t wait much longer.

1078
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,533
My Snow Dragons!

1079
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:39,408
It's been ages.

1080
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:41,783
They still recognize me!

1081
01:38:44,366 --> 01:38:46,116
You've been away for too long.

1082
01:38:46,241 --> 01:38:48,616
You probably don’t know your way back anymore.

1083
01:38:49,533 --> 01:38:52,616
These two Snow Dragons were a gift from Father,

1084
01:38:53,283 --> 01:38:55,033
but I’ve trained them over the years.

1085
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,491
They are fast...

1086
01:38:58,033 --> 01:38:59,283
...and know their way around.

1087
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:14,450
The treasures you brought...

1088
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,783
...do not please me;

1089
01:40:17,325 --> 01:40:18,283
but your presence...

1090
01:40:19,116 --> 01:40:20,491
...pleases me greatly.

1091
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:27,200
Tell me,

1092
01:40:27,866 --> 01:40:29,241
what do you want?

1093
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:31,450
Today, I will grant your every wish.

1094
01:40:52,616 --> 01:40:54,158
My father is too old and weak...

1095
01:40:54,408 --> 01:40:56,450
...to survive prison.

1096
01:40:56,783 --> 01:40:58,283
Would you take pity on him...

1097
01:40:58,408 --> 01:40:59,741
...and release him?

1098
01:40:59,908 --> 01:41:01,700
Punish me...

1099
01:41:02,408 --> 01:41:04,033
...in his place.

1100
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:08,408
Your father was sentenced to death.

1101
01:41:13,658 --> 01:41:15,491
Then I would die for him.

1102
01:42:10,366 --> 01:42:11,908
Ji Fa, it's me.

1103
01:42:14,825 --> 01:42:15,783
Demon monk!

1104
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:19,033
Every time you show up, something bad happens.

1105
01:42:19,866 --> 01:42:20,866
Where is Yin Jiao?

1106
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,033
Take me to see him!

1107
01:42:22,033 --> 01:42:23,741
You won’t rest until we’re all killed!

1108
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:25,158
I'm the only one who can save him.

1109
01:42:25,158 --> 01:42:26,825
He can stay in Zhaoge no longer.

1110
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,075
Last time you got away,

1111
01:42:31,158 --> 01:42:32,575
but this time you surrendered yourself.

1112
01:42:33,533 --> 01:42:34,408
Stop talking.

1113
01:42:34,408 --> 01:42:35,950
Come with me.

1114
01:42:37,116 --> 01:42:38,533
Leave Zhaoge.

1115
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:40,700
Kunlun will protect you.

1116
01:42:41,116 --> 01:42:43,200
You're the future King of All Realms.

1117
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:45,116
The people’s future...

1118
01:42:45,116 --> 01:42:45,783
...depends on...

1119
01:42:47,991 --> 01:42:49,908
My father is the King of All Realms.

1120
01:42:50,283 --> 01:42:51,575
He’s the one that will open the Fengshen Bang...

1121
01:42:51,616 --> 01:42:52,825
...and save the world!

1122
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,408
I told you, old man.

1123
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,658
He won't listen to you.

1124
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,366
You still believe him?

1125
01:42:59,575 --> 01:43:01,533
My Father is bewitched by a fox demon.

1126
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,491
Good and bad fortunes...

1127
01:43:05,616 --> 01:43:07,241
...don't happen by accident.

1128
01:43:08,491 --> 01:43:10,241
Those with evil intentions...

1129
01:43:10,991 --> 01:43:12,950
...attract demons.

1130
01:43:14,325 --> 01:43:15,741
What if...

1131
01:43:16,575 --> 01:43:21,783
What if your father is not bewitched by a fox demon?

1132
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:27,908
If we can lure Daji to this place...

1133
01:43:27,908 --> 01:43:29,200
...and kill the fox,

1134
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,241
then we will know the truth.

1135
01:43:39,616 --> 01:43:42,408
It pains me to see how you’ve suffered.

1136
01:43:45,783 --> 01:43:47,533
Are you here to kill me?

1137
01:44:01,616 --> 01:44:03,283
I envy you...

1138
01:44:03,991 --> 01:44:05,700
...for having two good sons.

1139
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:08,450
I, on the other hand,

1140
01:44:08,866 --> 01:44:10,366
only have one,

1141
01:44:11,033 --> 01:44:12,533
who wants to kill me.

1142
01:44:14,366 --> 01:44:15,866
We're both fathers.

1143
01:44:17,033 --> 01:44:18,533
Why am I so afflicted?

1144
01:44:20,783 --> 01:44:24,200
However you treat your own father,

1145
01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:29,783
your son will follow that example.

1146
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,866
But you have no idea...

1147
01:44:32,408 --> 01:44:34,575
...how my father treated me.

1148
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,575
I have great admiration for you.

1149
01:44:51,658 --> 01:44:53,283
What should I do?

1150
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,908
I'd like to hear your advice.

1151
01:44:58,408 --> 01:45:01,033
If you keep your word...

1152
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:03,366
...and sacrifice yourself,

1153
01:45:04,116 --> 01:45:05,783
your sins...

1154
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,033
...will be absolved,

1155
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:15,158
and you’ll be an honorable descendant of Cheng Tang.

1156
01:45:16,741 --> 01:45:18,283
The thing is,

1157
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:22,116
can you do it?

1158
01:45:33,408 --> 01:45:36,866
Bo Yikao is here? In Zhaoge?

1159
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,200
Where is he?

1160
01:45:44,033 --> 01:45:46,366
You love your son so much.

1161
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:50,658
Don't you recognize how he tastes?

1162
01:45:57,616 --> 01:45:59,575
Even beasts don't eat their cubs.

1163
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,241
You are less than an animal.

1164
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,950
You want a bite?

1165
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:22,616
Have a bite.

1166
01:46:24,116 --> 01:46:25,741
Take it!

1167
01:46:28,533 --> 01:46:30,158
Take it!

1168
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:34,325
You monster!

1169
01:46:34,825 --> 01:46:38,950
Kill me!

1170
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:40,575
I promised Bo Yikao...

1171
01:46:40,991 --> 01:46:42,200
...that I wouldn’t kill you...

1172
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:44,075
...and that I’d release you.

1173
01:46:45,491 --> 01:46:47,283
You know what you have to do.

1174
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:56,658
Remember,

1175
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:01,033
I still have your other son in my hands.

1176
01:47:50,116 --> 01:47:52,158
I have sinned.

1177
01:47:53,908 --> 01:47:57,408
I made a false divination.

1178
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,950
I plotted treason.

1179
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:04,908
I instigated a revolt.

1180
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:09,366
I am a criminal.

1181
01:48:09,366 --> 01:48:12,283
I am unforgivable.

1182
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,283
I have sinned.

1183
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:20,783
I made a false divination.

1184
01:48:20,783 --> 01:48:24,325
I plotted treason.

1185
01:48:24,991 --> 01:48:26,075
I...

1186
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:30,825
I instigated a revolt.

1187
01:48:34,033 --> 01:48:37,616
I made a false divination.

1188
01:48:39,575 --> 01:48:42,533
I plotted treason.

1189
01:48:44,241 --> 01:48:45,825
I...

1190
01:48:46,783 --> 01:48:48,366
...instigated a revolt.

1191
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:51,741
I am a criminal.

1192
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:00,325
I am a criminal.

1193
01:49:02,741 --> 01:49:04,325
I...

1194
01:49:04,325 --> 01:49:07,908
I made a false divination.

1195
01:49:18,783 --> 01:49:20,783
I, Yin Shou,

1196
01:49:20,783 --> 01:49:23,700
have brought Lady Su to meet our ancestors...

1197
01:49:24,866 --> 01:49:27,325
...and ask for their blessing.

1198
01:49:36,491 --> 01:49:38,533
Come closer.

1199
01:49:38,741 --> 01:49:41,825
Let the ancestors see you.

1200
01:49:58,075 --> 01:50:01,450
If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes,

1201
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:06,241
I’d never believe that such beauty could exist.

1202
01:50:07,325 --> 01:50:09,158
Give me your hand.

1203
01:50:18,075 --> 01:50:18,866
Fox Demon,

1204
01:50:18,866 --> 01:50:22,241
I’ve locked your meridian pathway!

1205
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:24,491
Prepare to die.

1206
01:50:24,491 --> 01:50:26,908
How can you say she’s a fox demon?

1207
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:29,575
Yin Jiao.

1208
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,325
So this is where you've been hiding.

1209
01:50:44,241 --> 01:50:45,908
I saw with my own eyes...

1210
01:50:46,783 --> 01:50:48,533
...how the fox demon inhabits Daji's body.

1211
01:50:49,866 --> 01:50:51,408
Father, I wounded you by accident,

1212
01:50:51,408 --> 01:50:53,616
when I was trying to kill this demon...

1213
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:55,575
...and avenge Mother.

1214
01:50:56,325 --> 01:50:58,366
Daji has been with me all this time.

1215
01:50:58,866 --> 01:51:00,575
If she were a fox demon, I would know.

1216
01:51:00,575 --> 01:51:01,991
When I kill her,

1217
01:51:01,991 --> 01:51:05,325
her true form will reveal itself.

1218
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:07,575
What if she’s not a fox demon?

1219
01:51:07,741 --> 01:51:09,325
You will have taken an innocent life!

1220
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,741
As the High Priest,

1221
01:51:17,116 --> 01:51:20,116
I have a magical heart with seven chambers.

1222
01:51:20,950 --> 01:51:22,908
Upon consuming this heart,

1223
01:51:23,116 --> 01:51:24,450
any demon...

1224
01:51:24,866 --> 01:51:28,533
...will revert to its original form.

1225
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:31,950
You would give up your heart for this?

1226
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:33,616
What is my heart...

1227
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,366
...compared to the royal family...

1228
01:51:36,575 --> 01:51:39,158
...and our dynasty?

1229
01:51:44,825 --> 01:51:49,616
But if Su Daji is indeed a fox demon,

1230
01:51:49,741 --> 01:51:52,158
what will Your Majesty do?

1231
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:56,241
Name your terms.

1232
01:51:57,533 --> 01:51:58,991
She must be put to death.

1233
01:52:00,325 --> 01:52:02,616
Yin Jiao must be pardoned.

1234
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:05,991
And the Four Dukes must be declared innocent.

1235
01:52:06,783 --> 01:52:08,741
In the name of our ancestors,

1236
01:52:09,366 --> 01:52:12,783
swear to do all this.

1237
01:52:17,616 --> 01:52:19,575
As the ancestors are my witness,

1238
01:52:20,741 --> 01:52:22,033
I swear it!

1239
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,866
Grand uncle, you mustn’t!

1240
01:52:44,783 --> 01:52:45,700
Swallow it!

1241
01:53:26,741 --> 01:53:29,116
Fox demon, you won’t harm His Majesty!

1242
01:53:32,658 --> 01:53:34,033
The fox demon has shown itself.

1243
01:53:34,116 --> 01:53:37,033
Now, Your Majesty, kill it!

1244
01:53:40,866 --> 01:53:42,700
In the name of our ancestors,

1245
01:53:43,116 --> 01:53:46,783
Yin Shou, what are you waiting for?

1246
01:53:49,408 --> 01:53:50,366
Our ancestors?

1247
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:57,200
Where are these ancestors?

1248
01:54:01,075 --> 01:54:03,283
If I call out to them, do they answer?

1249
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,283
You all say the white fox is a demon.

1250
01:54:09,658 --> 01:54:11,783
In fact, she’s a charm.

1251
01:54:14,116 --> 01:54:17,408
Only she knows what I truly desire.

1252
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:19,825
You want to be...

1253
01:54:20,908 --> 01:54:26,325
...King of All The World.

1254
01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:39,908
The Shang Dynasty...

1255
01:54:40,616 --> 01:54:42,116
...is finished.

1256
01:54:45,491 --> 01:54:46,158
High Priest!

1257
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:47,825
The Shang Dynasty...

1258
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:51,408
...is truly finished.

1259
01:54:57,991 --> 01:54:59,575
Grand Uncle!

1260
01:55:01,116 --> 01:55:02,366
The Shang Dynasty...

1261
01:55:06,283 --> 01:55:08,116
Get the High Priest out of here.

1262
01:55:25,241 --> 01:55:26,533
Treacherous boy,

1263
01:55:27,908 --> 01:55:29,450
what do you find so amusing?

1264
01:55:32,241 --> 01:55:34,658
I thought you were bewitched by the fox demon.

1265
01:55:36,533 --> 01:55:39,075
That's why I kept hoping that...

1266
01:55:39,533 --> 01:55:41,366
...you would turn back into...

1267
01:55:41,366 --> 01:55:43,700
...the father...

1268
01:55:43,991 --> 01:55:45,575
...that I respected and looked up to.

1269
01:55:46,075 --> 01:55:47,700
I was such a fool.

1270
01:55:50,408 --> 01:55:53,450
You did this!

1271
01:55:57,991 --> 01:55:59,866
You gave me my life.

1272
01:56:01,783 --> 01:56:03,616
Now you can take it back!

1273
01:56:06,325 --> 01:56:07,075
Yin Jiao!

1274
01:56:21,075 --> 01:56:22,158
Guards!

1275
01:56:25,991 --> 01:56:27,241
Take him away.

1276
01:56:36,533 --> 01:56:38,200
He’ll be executed at the Meridian Gate tomorrow.

1277
01:56:47,366 --> 01:56:49,700
Don’t think I don’t know what you’ve been up to.

1278
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:50,908
I would never...

1279
01:57:04,241 --> 01:57:05,700
Of all the hostages,

1280
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,700
you were my favorite,

1281
01:57:10,325 --> 01:57:12,741
because on the day you arrived in Zhaoge,

1282
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:14,450
you told me that...

1283
01:57:14,866 --> 01:57:17,283
...you wanted to be a hero.

1284
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:21,241
We are one of a kind,

1285
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:23,366
therefore,

1286
01:57:25,158 --> 01:57:26,950
I'll give you one last chance.

1287
01:57:27,866 --> 01:57:29,408
Go and kill Ji Chang.

1288
01:57:32,575 --> 01:57:33,366
Do that for me...

1289
01:57:35,158 --> 01:57:38,200
...and you’ll become my son and heir,

1290
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:41,033
the Crown Prince of Shang.

1291
01:57:42,658 --> 01:57:44,533
Don’t disappoint me again.

1292
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:54,783
I'm a criminal.

1293
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:59,283
I'm unforgivable.

1294
01:58:01,866 --> 01:58:04,075
I have sinned.

1295
01:58:23,033 --> 01:58:25,825
I thought I would never again see the light of day,

1296
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:28,450
but you saved me.

1297
01:58:29,783 --> 01:58:31,366
I practised for a thousand years...

1298
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,950
...so as to take on human form...

1299
01:58:34,283 --> 01:58:36,283
...and partake in the pleasures of life.

1300
01:58:38,616 --> 01:58:42,325
But King Cheng Tang sealed me inside the Xuanyuan Tomb.

1301
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:45,158
It's been 500 years...

1302
01:58:47,366 --> 01:58:51,283
Only the blood of his descendants could break the seal.

1303
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:56,116
You brought me back to life.

1304
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:01,533
In return,

1305
01:59:02,325 --> 01:59:04,575
I used a soul transference spell...

1306
01:59:04,991 --> 01:59:07,241
...to inhabit Yin Qi's body...

1307
01:59:08,283 --> 01:59:10,033
...to help you do what you wanted to do,

1308
01:59:11,033 --> 01:59:13,866
to take what you wanted to have.

1309
01:59:17,575 --> 01:59:19,366
I will make you immortal,

1310
01:59:21,116 --> 01:59:22,783
a King for all eternity.

1311
01:59:39,825 --> 01:59:42,158
A subject serves his king...

1312
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:43,950
...like the sun and moon in the sky.

1313
01:59:44,991 --> 01:59:48,116
Such is the basis of a nation.

1314
01:59:49,325 --> 01:59:51,200
A son serves his father...

1315
01:59:51,491 --> 01:59:53,325
...like the gods in the heavens above.

1316
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:56,158
Such is the foundation of a family.

1317
01:59:57,158 --> 02:00:00,783
That's why there is no greater sin...

1318
02:00:00,783 --> 02:00:03,450
...than the murder of one's father and king.

1319
02:00:03,783 --> 02:00:05,075
The traitorous son, Yin Jiao,

1320
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:07,200
disregarding all law and ethics,

1321
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:08,825
armed with murderous intent...

1322
02:00:09,033 --> 02:00:11,366
So then, Ji Chang,

1323
02:00:11,616 --> 02:00:12,825
which one of us was fated to die...

1324
02:00:12,825 --> 02:00:15,741
...by the hand of his own flesh and blood?

1325
02:00:15,741 --> 02:00:17,450
Yin Shou!

1326
02:00:18,908 --> 02:00:22,825
Dead or alive, I’m coming for you!

1327
02:00:22,991 --> 02:00:24,658
Proceed with the execution!

1328
02:00:36,533 --> 02:00:39,075
Nezha, Yang Jian, where are you?

1329
02:00:51,658 --> 02:00:52,783
Brothers of Xiqi,

1330
02:00:53,325 --> 02:00:54,700
save Yin Jiao!

1331
02:01:05,075 --> 02:01:05,991
Stop them!

1332
02:01:11,533 --> 02:01:13,825
You dared to deceive me?!

1333
02:01:15,533 --> 02:01:16,950
Release Yin Jiao,

1334
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:18,033
or I’ll have to kill you.

1335
02:01:20,575 --> 02:01:21,950
You don't have what it takes.

1336
02:01:24,241 --> 02:01:25,283
Execute him!

1337
02:01:34,408 --> 02:01:35,158
Comrade,

1338
02:01:35,533 --> 02:01:36,575
let me send you on your way.

1339
02:02:09,408 --> 02:02:11,533
You think you’ll kill me?

1340
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,241
Don’t forget,

1341
02:02:13,908 --> 02:02:16,283
I taught you everything you know.

1342
02:02:16,575 --> 02:02:17,741
Save Ji Fa!

1343
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,325
Nezha, Yang Jian, I'm here!

1344
02:02:40,033 --> 02:02:40,908
Master Ziya!

1345
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,658
Come with us! Let’s go!

1346
02:02:43,783 --> 02:02:46,325
Don't worry about me. Take Yin Jiao with you.

1347
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:48,908
Yin Jiao is in two sections! He’s dead.

1348
02:02:48,908 --> 02:02:49,825
Stop wasting time!

1349
02:02:49,825 --> 02:02:52,158
Take him to Kunlun immediately!

1350
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:11,325
Water Teleportation!

1351
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,366
Did they have to both go?

1352
02:03:56,658 --> 02:03:58,325
If the gods won't kill you,

1353
02:03:58,450 --> 02:03:59,325
I will.

1354
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:29,658
His Majesty is dead.

1355
02:04:30,366 --> 02:04:33,991
I, Duke of the North, give the orders now.

1356
02:04:55,033 --> 02:04:56,991
Bring me Ji Fa.

1357
02:05:11,575 --> 02:05:12,991
Why are you still in Zhaoge?

1358
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,366
You must have a death wish!

1359
02:05:25,408 --> 02:05:26,575
Soul Transference!

1360
02:06:03,825 --> 02:06:05,241
Yin Shou is dead.

1361
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,116
I killed him.

1362
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:11,783
He’s the one responsible for the Great Curse.

1363
02:06:12,075 --> 02:06:13,866
Stop them!

1364
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:24,991
Jiang Wenhuan, if you wish to avenge him,

1365
02:06:26,491 --> 02:06:27,950
do it now.

1366
02:06:55,116 --> 02:06:56,283
Stand down!

1367
02:06:58,825 --> 02:06:59,325
Let them go.

1368
02:07:06,033 --> 02:07:07,283
Go!

1369
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:18,908
Close the gates.

1370
02:07:19,033 --> 02:07:20,241
Prepare for battle!

1371
02:07:45,783 --> 02:07:46,825
Someone is coming through!

1372
02:07:46,825 --> 02:07:47,866
Stop him!

1373
02:07:53,241 --> 02:07:54,283
Stop him now!

1374
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:02,033
It's a fugitive.

1375
02:08:23,158 --> 02:08:24,658
Into the forest!

1376
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,866
Keep up!

1377
02:08:35,575 --> 02:08:36,866
What is this?

1378
02:09:06,241 --> 02:09:07,158
Release the arrows!

1379
02:09:18,575 --> 02:09:20,533
Ji Fa, go. Save yourself.

1380
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,533
It's me they're after.

1381
02:09:24,325 --> 02:09:25,575
I’m going to borrow something of yours.

1382
02:09:25,783 --> 02:09:26,575
What?

1383
02:10:54,033 --> 02:10:57,283
Not so fast, my Taoist Brother.

1384
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:07,783
You!

1385
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:34,825
Jiang Ziya! You won’t get away!

1386
02:13:00,075 --> 02:13:01,658
Who are you?

1387
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:14,950
Lei Zhenzi.

1388
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:24,283
My child,

1389
02:13:25,825 --> 02:13:28,325
let's go home.

1390
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:15,741
These two Snow Dragons were gifts from Father.

1391
02:14:16,033 --> 02:14:17,866
I've trained them over the years.

1392
02:14:18,741 --> 02:14:20,658
Whenever you want to return,

1393
02:14:20,825 --> 02:14:22,700
just say to them:

1394
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:24,241
“Home”.

1395
02:14:24,741 --> 02:14:26,408
And they'll take you back to Xiqi.

1396
02:14:36,075 --> 02:14:37,658
The circle.

1397
02:14:41,908 --> 02:14:42,950
Father,

1398
02:14:44,241 --> 02:14:46,491
I promise I'll return home to Xiqi.

1399
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,033
Circle.

1400
02:15:00,491 --> 02:15:02,075
Full circle.

1401
02:15:15,158 --> 02:15:16,991
Home.

1402
02:15:57,825 --> 02:15:59,200
It’s a Snow Dragon!

1403
02:15:59,366 --> 02:16:01,366
Young Master's back!

1404
02:16:17,825 --> 02:16:18,658
Father.

1405
02:16:44,825 --> 02:16:46,158
Come.

1406
02:16:56,991 --> 02:16:58,325
Full circle.

1407
02:17:07,658 --> 02:17:08,700
Father,

1408
02:17:12,741 --> 02:17:14,491
I'm back.

1409
02:24:47,741 --> 02:24:50,700
Shang Commander Wen Zhong,

1410
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:56,366
after ten years of battle near the North Sea,

1411
02:24:56,491 --> 02:25:00,325
has returned in victory!
