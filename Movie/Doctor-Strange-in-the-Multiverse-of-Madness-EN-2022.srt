1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
- Did that kill it?
- No.

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,857
That's how we kill it.

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,155
The Book of Vishanti!

4
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,178
We can't let it take your power.

5
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
Get to the book.

6
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,371
- How do we get across?
- Jump.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,709
Hold on!

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
No, no, no!

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,547
It's too strong.

10
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,257
I can't hold it.

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,286
This is the only way.

13
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,498
What're you doing?

14
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,542
I can't let that thing take your power.

15
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,586
You can't control it.

16
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
But I can.

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,965
But we're friends.

18
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,509
You're killing me.

19
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,677
I know.

20
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,723
But in the grand calculus
of the Multiverse,

21
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,850
your sacrifice
is worth more than your...

22
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,186
Excuse me. May I?

23
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
Thanks.

24
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,001
Doctor Strange.

25
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,252
Doctor West.

26
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,213
Haven't seen you in a while.

27
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,426
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...

28
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,094
So were a lot of us.

29
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,515
While I was gone,

30
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,851
thank you for asking,

31
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,687
I lost both my cats...

32
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,233
and my brother.

33
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,946
I'm very sorry.

34
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,240
Thank you.

35
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,869
I, uh...

36
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,915
I guess what keeps me up
at night is wondering,

37
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,668
did it have to happen that way?

38
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,756
Was there any other path?

39
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,635
No.

40
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,681
No, I made the only play we had.

41
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,808
Well, of course you did.

42
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,562
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

43
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,651
But you still didn't get the girl.

44
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,160
Glass of red, please.

45
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,246
- Oh, allow me, miss.
- Mm.

46
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,332
- Ah.
- Little too on the nose?

47
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,167
What? For you, at my wedding?

48
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,420
Nah. I think it was perfect.

49
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
Congratulations.

50
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,172
Thank you.

51
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,133
Mm. There's Charlie.

52
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,510
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

53
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,763
It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...

54
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,390
Hey, uh, Christine. Um...

55
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,017
I should've...

56
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,135
I wish I'd have been different.

57
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,150
I never stopped caring about us.

58
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,402
But I had to make sacrifices

59
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,696
to protect you.

60
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,912
It was never gonna work out
between us.

62
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,583
Why not?

63
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,585
Because, Stephen,

64
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,045
you have to be the one
holding the knife.

65
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,298
And I always respected you for it,

66
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,175
but I couldn't love you for it.

67
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,806
How long you had that one
in the barrel?

68
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,310
Long time.

69
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,312
Yeah. I bet.

70
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
Look, um...

71
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,692
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

72
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
Mm.

73
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,029
I am.

74
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
I really, really am.

75
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
Good.

76
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
Are you?

77
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,870
I'm happy.

78
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,455
Good.

79
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
You deserve it.

80
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,885
Oh, man.
Look out! What is that?

81
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,888
Dude!

82
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,602
Thank you.

83
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,480
Wow!

84
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320
No, no.

85
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,252
Look out!

86
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,306
Do I know you?

87
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,451
Help!

88
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,167
You're welcome.

89
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,044
You know it's ancient custom

90
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,213
to bow in the presence
of the Sorcerer Supreme?

91
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,382
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

92
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,807
Hold it, hold it! Whoa!

93
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,749
Whoa.

94
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,375
That's incredible.

95
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,793
Yeah.

96
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,133
Oh, God!

97
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
Who's this?

98
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,209
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

99
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
Hey, kid.

100
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,152
What did that creature want with you?

101
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,320
Where're your parents?

102
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,763
We'll take her back to the Sanc...

103
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,117
She took my Slingie.

104
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,869
She took your Slingie.

105
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,626
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

106
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,877
Oh, my God!

107
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,256
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

108
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,925
I just bust my ass
trying to save your life, remember?

109
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,346
Giant monsters I can clearly handle,

110
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,683
but what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.

111
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,395
That wasn't a dream.

112
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,438
It was another universe.

113
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,735
How much experience do you guys have
with the Multiverse?

114
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,883
We have experience of the Multiverse.

115
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,031
Most recently, there was
an incident with Spider-Man.

116
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,408
What man?

117
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,702
Spider-Man.
He has the powers of a spider.

118
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,829
- Hence the name.
- Gross.

119
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,112
- Does he look like a spider?
- No. No, more like a man.

120
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,291
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

121
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,893
- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?

122
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,168
No.

123
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,670
Well, maybe, I don't know.

124
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,880
Honestly, I hope not.

125
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,047
Super weird.

126
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,134
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

127
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,844
I'm from another universe.

128
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,738
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

129
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,972
I don't.

130
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,474
I don't even know
if you're from another universe,

131
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,578
which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you

132
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,829
to enlighten us.

133
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,854
Gotta say,

134
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,198
of the two Doctor Stranges
I've met so far...

135
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,730
...you're not my favorite.

136
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,502
Which means?

137
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,987
Does he not know Spanish?

138
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,865
I'm not sure
he even enjoys speaking English.

139
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,635
Look,
I left a very nice wedding

140
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,495
to save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.

141
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,639
- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me...

142
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,706
- Christine's.
- You went?

143
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,933
Holy shit, you married Christine?

144
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,997
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

145
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,209
No, I didn't. Yes.

146
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
You need to explain to me
what's going on.

147
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,714
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

148
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,674
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

149
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,094
It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.

150
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,056
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

151
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,307
What power?

152
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,352
I can travel the Multiverse.

153
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
What?

154
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,314
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

155
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,565
- Mm-hmm.
- How?

156
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,609
That's the problem.
I don't know how.

157
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
Can't control it.

158
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,196
Only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.

159
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,492
Okay. And did Other Me know
how to defeat this demon?

160
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
Well, you guys knew

161
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,662
of this magical book of pure good

162
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,873
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.

163
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,084
The Book of Vishanti?

164
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,669
It's not real.

165
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,129
It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.

166
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,297
Actually, it does.

167
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,985
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

168
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,219
Unbelievable.

169
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,637
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

170
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

171
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,283
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme
of his universe.

172
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,409
Right. Yeah.

173
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,060
Although it does exist,

174
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,479
the Book of Vishanti
is said to be unreachable.

175
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,898
It is. Except...

176
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
we reached it.

177
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,821
Then the demon caught up with us.

178
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
I thought you'd protect me...

179
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,577
but you didn't.

180
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,162
That was the fight in my dream.

181
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,082
That wasn't a dream.

182
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
Prove it.

183
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,927
It wasn't a dream.

184
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,436
That means...

185
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,024
dreams are windows into the lives
of our Multiversal selves.

186
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,902
That was his theory.

187
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,947
So, that recurring nightmare
where I'm running naked from a clown...

188
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,575
Somewhere out there, it's real.

189
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,494
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

190
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,123
There could be
more creatures coming for her.

191
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,500
The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.

192
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,064
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

193
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,049
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

194
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,762
America Chavez.

195
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
Miss Chavez, will you come
with us to Kamar-Taj?

196
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,433
You'll be safe there.

197
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,311
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

198
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,439
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

199
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,736
What do we do with him?

200
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,954
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

201
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,581
Ah, I've buried worse.

202
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,044
The creature that killed him, did...

203
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,797
did it have the same markings
as the octopus?

204
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
Runes.

205
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,300
This isn't sorcery.

206
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
It's witchcraft.

207
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,639
Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?

208
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,976
I think I might.

209
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,065
- Chocolate!
- Hey! What did I say?

210
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
But we couldn't wait.

211
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,609
But what did I say?

212
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,320
Oh!

213
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,115
Go wash your hands.

214
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,913
Mom, come on.
We're too old for that.

215
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,249
Oh, okay.

216
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
You can tuck me in, Mom.

217
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,335
I will.

218
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,384
You know, a family is forever.

219
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,346
We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.

220
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,431
Mom, I changed my mind.

221
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,684
You can come tuck me in if you want.

222
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,018
Okay.

223
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,232
Love you.

224
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
Apples, right?

225
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,309
- Eventually.
- Hmm.

226
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,400
- Smells...
- Sweet.

227
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,527
I was gonna say real.

228
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,197
Oh, it's all very real, thanks.

229
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,241
I've put the magic behind me.

230
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,534
So I can see.

231
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,787
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up,

232
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,956
wanting to discuss
what happened at Westview.

233
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,836
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt...

234
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,673
But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.

235
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,718
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

236
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,987
Then what are you here for?

237
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,262
We need your help.

238
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,308
With what?

239
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,477
What do you know about the Multiverse?

240
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,270
The Multiverse.

241
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,521
Vis had his theories.

242
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,609
He believed it was real,
and dangerous.

243
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,277
Well, he was right about both.

244
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,656
We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it,

245
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,282
but she's being pursued.

246
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,992
- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.

247
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,078
- One that covets her power for itself.
- Ah.

248
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,582
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defenses,

249
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,459
but we could use an Avenger.

250
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,336
There are other Avengers.

251
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,089
Yeah, but given the choice
between the archer with the mohawk

252
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,341
and several bug-themed crime fighters,

253
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:04,346
or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...

254
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,847
...it's an easy call.

255
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,100
Come to Kamar-Taj.

256
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

257
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,608
What if you brought America here?

258
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,694
Here?

259
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,114
Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own,

260
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,783
hunted for abilities you never wanted,

261
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,369
and I can protect her.

262
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,894
You never told me her name, did you?

263
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,961
No.

264
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,755
- Mm.
- No, I didn't.

265
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,554
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

266
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,266
The lying, not so much.

267
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
The Darkhold.

268
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,962
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

269
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,964
I know it's the Book of the Damned,

270
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,551
and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

271
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,345
I wonder what it's done to you.

272
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,889
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

273
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,684
Everything I lost can be mine again.

274
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,394
What do you want with America?

275
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,438
What do you want with the Multiverse?

276
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,899
I'm going to leave this reality

277
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,152
and go to one where I can be
with my children.

278
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,613
Wanda, your children aren't real.

279
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,823
You created them using magic.

280
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,617
That's what every mother does.

281
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,163
If you knew

282
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,166
there was a universe

283
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,043
where you were happy,

284
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
wouldn't you want to go there?

285
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,172
I am happy.

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,092
I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.

287
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,429
What you're doing is a flagrant violation
of every natural law,

288
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,306
and if you take that child's power,

289
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
she won't survive.

290
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,684
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

291
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,020
But she's not a child.

292
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,356
She's a supernatural being.

293
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,109
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this

294
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,402
and other worlds.

295
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,986
Her sacrifice

296
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,280
would be for the greater good.

297
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,966
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

298
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,743
'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.

299
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,328
Is it the one you used

300
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,415
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

301
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,630
That was a war,
and I did what I had to do.

302
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,091
You break the rules and become a hero.

303
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,176
I do it, and I become the enemy.

304
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,096
That doesn't seem fair.

305
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,141
What happens now?

306
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,934
Return to Kamar-Taj

307
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,229
and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.

308
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,565
Peacefully.

309
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,984
After that...

310
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,447
You'll never see me again.

311
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,743
And if we don't?

312
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,542
Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.

313
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,753
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

314
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,891
The Scarlet Witch.

315
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,228
Wanda's gone.

316
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,565
She's got the Darkhold,
and the Darkhold has her.

317
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,322
The Scarlet Witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.

318
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,700
She can rewrite reality as she chooses,

319
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,662
and is prophesized to either rule

320
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,831
or annihilate the cosmos.

321
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,168
She took over a whole town using her mind.

322
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,130
If she gets America's power,

323
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,633
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

324
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,346
So, the person you went to ask for help,

325
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,723
and told exactly where I am,

326
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,450
is the person that's trying to kill me?

327
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
Yeah.

328
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,148
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

329
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,859
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

330
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,187
Wow.

331
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,815
It's the masters of the Hong Kong
and London Sanctums.

332
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,111
It's an honor to court death
alongside you once again.

333
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,445
The honor is ours.

334
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,031
Whatever the
Sorcerer Supreme asks of us,

335
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,533
it shall be done.

336
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,702
Extra duty men,
follow me.

337
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,912
It's ancient custom.

338
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
Choose your words wisely.

339
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,063
The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.

340
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,272
Got it.

341
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,983
No pressure, then.

342
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,291
All this for a child you met yesterday.

343
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,211
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

344
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,380
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

345
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,174
I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved,

346
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,303
and it meant nothing.

347
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,432
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen Strange.

348
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,485
If you give me what I want,

349
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,321
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

350
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,244
The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.

351
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,164
Defensive positions, now!

352
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,090
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

353
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,677
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

354
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,761
Yeah.

355
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,572
Book of the Damned,
calling yourself a witch,

356
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,056
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid,

357
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,475
I don't exactly call that
being reasonable.

358
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,103
Sending those creatures
after her instead of myself

359
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,688
was mercy.

360
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,568
And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults,

361
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,739
I have begged you
to safely get out of my way.

362
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,200
You have exhausted my patience,

363
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,789
but I do hope you understand
that even now,

364
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,458
what's about to happen,

365
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,502
this is me

366
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,338
being reasonable.

367
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,641
Hold!

368
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,895
Hold!

369
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,577
Nailed it.

370
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,249
Reinforce the shield.

371
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,959
Reinforce the shield!

372
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,419
Reinforce the shield!

373
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,024
She's trying to get in their heads.

374
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,402
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

375
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,500
Run.

376
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,233
The shield is down!

377
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,197
Fire!

378
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,743
Yes!

379
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,131
Take cover!

380
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,927
Fire at will!

381
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,107
Fall back.

382
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,318
Wong!

383
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,611
Get out of here!

384
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,576
Go, go.

385
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,911
Go!

386
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,535
America...

387
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,213
You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.

388
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,965
Fine.

389
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,202
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

390
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,871
Wong, what happened?

391
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,622
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

392
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,096
Reflections.

393
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,098
She's using the reflections.
Cover them.

394
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,049
You gave all those lives

395
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,843
just to keep me from my children.

396
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,428
You took those lives.

397
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,473
You cannot be allowed
to cross into the Multiverse.

398
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,725
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

399
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,477
I'm a mother.

400
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,437
Wanda, you have no children.

401
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,689
They don't exist.

402
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,566
Oh, but they do.

403
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,860
In every other universe.

404
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,279
I know they do.

405
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,782
Because I dream of them

406
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,452
every night.

407
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,918
We're gonna show it.

408
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,336
Mom, watch us. Mom!

409
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,671
Go long. Got it!

410
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,172
All right, go on back, go on back.

411
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,536
All right, yeah. Don't...

412
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,300
Of my boys.

413
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,694
Billy, don't you dare! No!

414
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,512
Of our life together.

415
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,948
- Here.
- Yes!

416
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,515
And then back to front.

417
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,933
Back to front.

418
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,601
Can I have some?

419
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,686
Please?

420
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,164
- Are you guys ready?
- It's okay.

421
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,231
I love you, Mom.

422
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,474
Every night...

423
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,236
the same dream.

424
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,531
And every morning...

425
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,620
the same nightmare.

426
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,208
What if you reach them?

427
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,628
What happens to the other you?

428
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,132
What happens to their mother?

429
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,532
You okay?

430
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,493
You saved me.

431
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,787
I hope so.

432
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,581
Surprised you didn't puke.

433
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,461
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

434
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,673
So, this is New York
in the Multi...

435
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,467
Yep.

436
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,969
There it is.

437
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,768
Crap.

438
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,355
Cut it out.

439
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,610
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

440
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,405
We'll get you fixed.

441
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,115
All right, America.

442
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,107
You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.

443
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,244
I don't know how.

444
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,454
You just did it.

445
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
Not on purpose.

446
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,583
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

447
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,834
I can't control my powers...

448
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,437
You must be able to control it somehow.

449
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,503
Even I could...

450
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,466
Sorry.

451
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,178
Well, what about this
universe's version of you?

452
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,138
Maybe she could
control her powers.

453
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,140
This universe doesn't have a me.

454
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,017
- What?
- None of them do.

455
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,143
But how do you know that?

456
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,770
'Cause I've looked.

457
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,357
And 'cause I never dream.

458
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,157
That's okay, kid.

459
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,410
And even if you could get me back there,
I have no way of fighting Wanda.

460
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,138
What about The Book of Vishanti?

461
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
What about it?

462
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,498
Other You thought it could stop

463
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,582
whoever was after me.

464
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,751
Yeah, well, good for Other Me.
He's not here, is he?

465
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,879
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another Other Me...

466
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,466
We need to go find...

467
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,761
Other Other Me.

468
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,627
We go on red?

469
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,380
Rule number one of Multiversal travel,

470
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,965
you don't know anything.

471
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,633
Right.

472
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,221
It's red.

473
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,225
So, what's rule number two?

474
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,646
America?

475
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,525
America!

476
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,569
Rule number two,

477
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,028
find food.

478
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,156
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

479
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,342
How'd you pay for that?

480
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,367
It was free.

481
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,786
Food's free
in most universes, actually.

482
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,830
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

483
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,016
- Hey! You didn't pay for that.
- Right.

484
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,083
Crap.

485
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,460
Maybe it's not free here.

486
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,587
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

487
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,630
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax.
She's just a kid...

488
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,983
- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself, there,

489
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,133
Doctor Strange.

490
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,261
Where'd you get
this cape from, anyway?

491
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,054
Oh, that feels authentic.

492
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,116
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

493
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,518
You took this whole suit
from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

494
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,479
- Strange Museum?
- You're a taker.

495
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,189
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

496
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,074
Come on. It's not permanent.

497
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,911
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

498
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,830
About three weeks.

499
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,002
Those universes we went through,

500
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
were we paint in one of them?

501
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,840
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

502
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,550
It's really hard to eat.

503
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,637
How many universes have you been to?

504
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,680
Uh...

505
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,848
Seventy-two.

506
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,767
Seventy-three, counting this one.

507
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,935
That's...

508
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,645
That's a lot.

509
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,021
Memory Lane.

510
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,731
Replay your significant memories,

511
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,525
now at a discounted price.

512
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,069
We remember so you don't forget.

513
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,327
This is pretty fancy.

514
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,038
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

515
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:25,000
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.

516
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,506
So, um, got you a little something.

517
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,885
Congratulations.

518
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,679
What is it?

519
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,347
Open it and see.

520
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,979
Christine, this is...

521
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
This is amazing. Thank you.

522
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,026
We don't have time for this.

523
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,030
Memory Lane.

524
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,865
Replay your significant memories,

525
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,701
now at a discounted price.

526
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,786
We remember so you don't forget.

527
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,336
Where's this?

528
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,673
Home.

529
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,092
My moms.

530
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,095
Son mis madres.

531
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,724
¿Para mí? Ay, qué linda.

532
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,726
Gracias.

533
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,729
A ver, te la pongo.

534
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
Mm. Tan hermosa.

535
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,859
Te ves bella.

536
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,321
Ándale, nos van a dar otra flor.

537
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,454
America!

538
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,266
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

539
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
Hey, kid.

540
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
That was the first time
that you opened a portal, right?

541
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,314
Doesn't matter.

542
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,024
It does matter.
You lost your parents.

543
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,485
I didn't lose them.
I killed them.

544
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,570
No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.

545
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,490
Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control

546
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,593
and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe,

547
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,761
- with no way to escape.
- Listen,

548
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,287
if your moms are
anything like their daughter,

549
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,622
they survived.

550
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,541
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

551
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,797
Not bad.

552
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,508
Thanks.

553
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,969
That woman in your memory bank thing,

554
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,429
that was Christine, right?

555
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,933
Yes, that was Christine.

556
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,893
- How do you know her?
- From Other You.

557
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,687
Were they together?

558
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,313
No, they didn't talk anymore.

559
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
He blew it.

560
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,565
Of course.

561
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,485
Did you blow it with your Christine?

562
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,863
Yes, I guess I did.

563
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,031
Why?

564
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,450
Complicated.

565
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,095
More complicated
than being chased by a witch

566
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
through the Multiverse?

567
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,163
Yes, actually, it is.

568
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,247
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

569
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,291
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

570
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,419
If Other You's dead,

571
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,379
who's Master of the Sanctum?

572
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,345
Oh, shit.

573
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,608
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

574
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,794
He was actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.

575
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,819
Oh, great.

576
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,904
And then he snapped

577
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,072
and dedicated his life
to trying to kill me.

578
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,616
Oh.

579
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,034
Great.

580
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,999
I always suspected
this day would come.

581
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,083
You did?

582
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,502
Yes.

583
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,131
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

584
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
My brother.

585
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,854
All right.

586
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,316
Come in,

587
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:03,654
and tell me everything
about your universe.

588
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,619
You go on red.

589
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,415
And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.

590
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,252
A Multiversal traveler.

591
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,672
Well, thank the stars
you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

592
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,508
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship
doesn't mean we're safe.

593
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,761
Our Wanda has the ability
to conjure demons and monsters

594
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,264
to attack America in other universes.

595
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,890
So she has the Darkhold?

596
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,475
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

597
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,270
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold
in this universe, too.

598
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,522
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

599
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,024
We would never
risk a weapon that dangerous

600
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,484
falling into the wrong hands.

601
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,694
Damn right.

602
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,571
But if your Darkhold
is anything like ours,

603
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,197
I'm afraid she can do far worse

604
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,826
than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

605
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
What do you mean?

606
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,748
There is a spell contained
within those pages...

607
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,168
...corrosive to the soul,

608
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,298
a desecration of reality itself.

609
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,217
Dreamwalking.

610
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,431
A Dreamwalking sorcerer
projects their own consciousness

611
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,142
from their universe into another,

612
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,062
possessing the body of an alternate self.

613
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,776
They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger

614
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,237
and pursue their enemies from afar.

615
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,035
The possession is not a permanent link

616
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,870
between realities.

617
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,623
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk,

618
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,668
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

619
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,382
So it may not be a demon that you face.

620
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,429
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

621
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,016
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

622
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,435
Because that
was her being reasonable.

623
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,326
What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?

624
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,940
The Darkhold's antithesis?

625
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,317
It can give a sorcerer

626
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,362
whatever power they need
to vanquish their enemy.

627
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,699
I need your help
to get me to it.

628
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,537
I'm sorry, Stephen.

629
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,793
But I hope you,
of all people, understand

630
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,337
that it is not Wanda Maximoff

631
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,673
who threatens our reality,

632
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,259
it's the two of you.

633
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,512
- Oh, God.
- What was in that tea?

634
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,103
You son of a bitch.

635
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,865
The Sands of Nisanti.

636
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,828
I'm only acting as you would.

637
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,708
She's coming.

638
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,958
Boys, it's time for bed.

639
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,662
Can we have
a little more ice cream?

640
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,044
- Please.
- Please, please, please!

641
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,069
A little more, please!

642
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,588
Hey, don't make Mom
out to be the bad guy.

643
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,756
You know who's the best?

644
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,158
- Who?
- 2003 Tigers.

645
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,242
They suck.

646
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,369
They're so bad they suck egg.

647
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,204
No, they don't.
They're the best.

648
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,081
- Doofus.
- Doofus 2.

649
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,083
Triple infinity doofus.

650
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,462
Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.

651
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:52,049
Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.

652
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,901
Googolplex doofus.

653
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,103
Mom?

654
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,193
Yes, sweetheart?

655
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,694
Where are you going?

656
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,867
Just to take out the trash.

657
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,787
Can we show you something?

658
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,291
Mom, hurry, come on!

659
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,793
Come on, it's important.

660
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,877
Mom.

661
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,712
You'll like it.

662
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,423
Come on. Hurry up.

663
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,633
It's important.

664
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,428
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

665
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,513
I'm gonna start it.

666
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,907
- No, I wanna start it.
- I wanna start it.

667
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,991
- I want to start!
- No, I want to start!

668
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,118
- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.

669
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,646
Why don't you both start it,

670
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,024
whatever it is, together?

671
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,485
Okay.

672
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,820
- You ready?
- Yeah.

673
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,614
Three, two, one, go.

674
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,160
We like ice cream

675
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,663
Like every child should

676
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,417
And if we get some ice cream

677
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,839
We promise to be good

678
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,868
You're alive.

679
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,578
Yes.

680
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,122
But so many others were lost.

681
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,417
Set me free.

682
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,085
I need to destroy the book.

683
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,047
No. It cannot be you.

684
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,098
Sara. No, no!

685
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,202
Mom!

686
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,578
What happened?

687
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,249
- What?
- Are you okay?

688
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,379
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

689
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,965
What?

690
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,683
No, no, no.

691
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,830
I need the Darkhold's spells.

692
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,457
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

693
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,875
Tell me what you know.

694
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,462
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

695
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,339
Not you.

696
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,009
Them.

697
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,308
Wanda, stop.

698
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,312
Wanda, please!

699
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,319
The Darkhold was a copy!

700
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,281
A copy?

701
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,741
Legend speaks of a mountain

702
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,577
with the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.

703
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,581
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

704
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,791
Mount Wundagore.

705
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,127
Wundagore?

706
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,796
No one has survived the journey.

707
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,887
Perhaps we will be the exception.

708
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,604
Hey!

709
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,647
Hey!

710
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,953
This universe sucks.

711
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,957
Cloak?

712
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,428
Hey.

713
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,473
Hey, lab coat.

714
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,308
Where the hell are we?

715
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,787
Look, I don't know who you are,

716
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,687
or what you think
you're trying to do here,

717
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,248
but these situations don't usually...

718
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,375
- Thank you.
- ...work out well

719
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,567
for the nameless scientists, so just...

720
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,448
Christine?

721
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,368
Hello, Stephen.

722
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,036
Ay Dios.

723
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,038
Miss Chavez.

724
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,999
Uh, to answer your question,

725
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,627
you are in a highly secure
research facility.

726
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,004
The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak,

727
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,048
are here for surveillance and testing.

728
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,259
Uh... Uh, testing?

729
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,928
Well, yes.
You're visitors from another universe.

730
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,640
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive,

731
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,435
you may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.

732
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,147
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

733
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,234
I assume I have you
to thank for these then?

734
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,946
Yes. I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.

735
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,407
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

736
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,616
838 Stephen?

737
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,285
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

738
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,287
Our universe is 838,

739
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,747
and we've designated yours 616.

740
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,750
Oh. You guys sure must know
a lot about the Multiverse

741
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,086
if you got someone
going around naming realities.

742
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,254
Yes.

743
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,256
Me.

744
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,425
I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter Foundation,

745
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,552
and I specialize in Multiversal research.

746
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,015
So,
how'd you end up working here?

747
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,058
Wherever here is.

748
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,625
Well, I volunteered.

749
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,520
At your funeral.

750
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,064
Thank you for going.

751
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,609
Your injuries, they're similar,

752
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,860
but they're not identical.

753
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,153
It's fascinating.

754
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:20,246
What were we to each other
in this universe?

755
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,919
We never quite figured that out.

756
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
Yeah?

757
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,049
Well, that's something we got in common.

758
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,096
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

759
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,641
Everyone's in real danger.

760
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,768
Look, I know you don't know me...

761
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
And I don't want to.

762
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,939
Whatever I was to you in your universe

763
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,232
does not matter.

764
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,567
Why not?

765
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,241
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

766
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,578
Someone from my universe
wants that girl,

767
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,456
and she's gonna rip this place
apart atom-by-atom

768
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,166
until she gets what she wants.

769
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,627
So I don't care
if you're from the Avengers

770
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,711
or S.H.I.E.L.D...

771
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,837
We're neither.

772
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,928
Well, what then?

773
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,137
HYDRA?

774
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,392
The Illuminati will see you now.

775
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,768
The Illumi-what-y?

776
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,486
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

777
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,158
It's gonna be okay.

778
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,357
You couldn't portal us up there?

779
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,943
My magic can only take us so far.

780
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,613
Masters of the Mystic Arts
weren't meant to tread

781
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,157
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

782
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,853
Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon,

783
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,649
carved his dark magic into this tomb.

784
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:57,570
These same spells were later transcribed
into the Darkhold.

785
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,547
There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.

786
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,967
They've been waiting for me.

787
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,977
This isn't a tomb.

788
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,733
It's a throne.

789
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,478
Stephen Strange,

790
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,773
you are now called before the Illuminati.

791
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,233
I, Baron Karl Mordo,

792
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,818
the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

793
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,028
"Karl"?

794
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,510
Captain Carter.

795
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,744
The first Avenger.

796
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,121
Blackagar Boltagon.

797
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,124
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists,
the Inhuman king.

798
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,418
Blackagar Boltagard? Huh.

799
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,045
Hidigy hidithere.

800
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,382
Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

801
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,470
And the smartest man alive,

802
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,223
Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

803
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,558
Hello, Stephen.

804
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,144
"Fantastic Four."
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

805
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,396
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

806
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,957
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head,

807
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,274
so, yeah, a little bit.

808
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,278
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.

809
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,113
Why? Does he have bad breath?

810
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,324
This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

811
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,535
- Hmm.
- No, just more alive.

812
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,828
For now.

813
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,789
Stephen, your arrival here

814
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,291
confuses and destabilizes reality.

815
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,770
The larger the footprint you leave behind,

816
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,587
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

817
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,672
Incursion?

818
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,840
An Incursion occurs

819
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,009
when the boundary
between two universes erodes

820
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,386
and they collide,

821
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:13,140
destroying one or both entirely.

822
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,561
Your alternate self created the Illuminati

823
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,188
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

824
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,067
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

825
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,986
So, before we vote,

826
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,823
if you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.

827
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,199
Yeah, I do.

828
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,718
If it's Incursions you're worried about,

829
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,453
do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat
than the Scarlet Witch?

830
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,665
Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to Dreamwalk.

831
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,083
No. No, you cannot.

832
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,252
Not unless you give me
The Book of Vishanti.

833
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,795
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

834
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,047
but it's not the Scarlet Witch
that we fear.

835
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,883
From our experience, the greatest danger

836
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,926
to the Multiverse, it turns out,

837
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,720
is Doctor Strange.

838
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,639
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

839
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,309
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

840
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,232
We should tell him the truth.

841
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,528
Our final member,

842
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,615
Professor Charles Xavier.

843
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,492
What truth?

844
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,245
That's not how our Strange died.

845
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,015
You're wondering what happens now.

846
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,017
No.

847
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,810
That I've already accepted.

848
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,687
But I do wonder

849
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,734
when you could force America
to send you to any universe you want,

850
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,778
why take her power for your own?

851
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,696
You know it would kill her.

852
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,615
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

853
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,159
What if they get sick?

854
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,372
In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

855
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,001
A solution to every problem.

856
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,339
I won't lose them again.

857
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,509
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

858
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,219
But I can.

859
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,012
Look around you.

860
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,890
It's carved in stone.

861
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,269
I was meant to rule everything.

862
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,985
But that's not what I want.

863
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,945
I just want my boys.

864
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,072
At the cost of a child's life?

865
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,825
Is there no peace in knowing

866
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,285
that even though you can't be
with the ones you love,

867
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,579
there are worlds
where you are together?

868
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:41,747
Is that not enough?

869
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,541
No.

870
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,081
Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.

871
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,417
We were at war.

872
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:30,296
While the rest of us banded together
to try to stop Thanos,

873
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,425
Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.

874
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,302
He turned to the Darkhold,

875
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,054
began Dreamwalking,

876
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,765
in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.

877
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,380
And guess what?

878
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:45,102
It didn't.
But he kept doing it anyway.

879
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,271
One night,
you called us all together,

880
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,398
confessed that
you had been Dreamwalking,

881
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,860
and in your words,
"Things had gotten out of hand."

882
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,321
You never told us the details
of what had happened,

883
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,323
only that you had
inadvertently triggered

884
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,574
an Incursion.

885
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,451
You, our friend,

886
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,455
had caused the annihilation
of another universe.

887
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,249
Everyone in that reality died.

888
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,417
Everyone.

889
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,865
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil

890
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,047
and helped us find
The Book of Vishanti,

891
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:17,343
a weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.

892
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,678
But one final threat remained.

893
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,084
I shall miss you, my friend.

894
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,339
I'm ready.

895
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,641
I'm sorry.

896
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,956
Did you tell Christine?

897
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,292
Yes.

898
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:37,965
The statue...

899
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,508
What about the statue?

900
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,762
You built a statue.

901
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,556
The world needs heroes.

902
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,409
We made the difficult choice

903
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,435
because we knew what
our Strange was capable of.

904
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,438
What, perhaps,

905
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,232
every Doctor Strange is capable of.

906
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,362
The building's been breached.

907
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,489
No shit, genius.

908
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,575
Status report on sentries.

909
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,272
Stop where you...

910
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,539
Get back!

911
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,129
Stop where you are...

912
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,505
She's heading for the child.

913
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,382
Watch him.
We'll vote on our return.

914
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,929
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber,

915
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,097
you must guide America Chavez.

916
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,557
What the hell are you saying?

917
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,018
Save the girl
and get to The Book of Vishanti.

918
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,645
What? You have the book here?

919
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,064
Yes. You built a waypoint.

920
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,316
Charles, we cannot trust him.

921
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,443
I believe we can.

922
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,738
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way

923
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,657
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

924
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,119
We will see what kind
of Doctor Strange you are.

925
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,913
Thank you.

926
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,457
Perimeter breakdown.

927
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,627
All sentries engage.

928
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,296
Everybody out.

929
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,140
- Intruder approaching.
- Now!

930
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,385
It's Wanda.

931
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,858
Ultron commands you to halt.

932
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,029
Ultron commands...

933
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,701
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

934
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,415
Oh, no.

935
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,187
Wanda, stop.

936
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,902
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

937
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,901
Let her go.

938
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,072
Please.

939
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,784
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

940
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,287
Is their mother still alive?

941
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,497
Yes.

942
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,877
Good. There will be
someone left to raise them.

943
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:26,508
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

944
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,428
What mouth?

945
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,614
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

946
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,741
You are in no position to give orders.

947
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,079
My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.

948
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,634
Haven't you had enough?

949
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,262
Oh, I could do this all day.

950
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,259
Get the hell out of my universe!

951
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,836
They're not coming back.

952
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,215
And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.

953
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:16,720
Not that that ever bothered you before.

954
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,017
You know, you hated me
where I came from.

955
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,852
And I bet secretly, my brother,

956
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,187
you hated me here.

957
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,231
You must've been so jealous.

958
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,732
Do you know what?

959
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:31,002
I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted.

960
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,921
Hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with...

961
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,780
You know nothing of this universe!

962
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,575
I know that killing Stephen Strange
was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,

963
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,202
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme,

964
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,089
and to joining
your little circus of clowns,

965
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,121
the Illuminati.

966
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,665
I'm ready...

967
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,629
to cast my vote now.

968
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,571
I think I'm beginning to understand

969
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,700
why your Mordo
didn't like you very much!

970
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,245
You're sealed shut!

971
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,798
Okay. Get back.

972
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,103
Whoa.

973
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,853
Enough!

974
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:32,958
Help me. Please.

975
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,752
Wanda Maximoff,
your mind is being held hostage

976
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:36,920
by your alternate self.

977
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,758
Grab my hand.

978
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:45,011
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble,

979
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,680
the spell will break.

980
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,479
Hey! You all right?

981
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:37,939
You okay?

982
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,400
Hey.

983
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,695
- You all right?
- Yeah.

984
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,448
Hey.

985
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,367
She fixed him.

986
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,803
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

987
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:52,930
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to The Book of Vishanti.

988
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:53,997
Can you take us there?

989
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,141
How am I supposed to trust you?

990
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,292
I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did,

991
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,544
but believe me,
The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

992
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,813
Yeah. Your way.

993
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,131
You sound a lot
like my Stephen right now.

994
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,692
He had to be the one holding the knife,

995
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,010
and then that knife
killed a trillion people.

996
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:08,762
This Stephen is different.

997
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,597
He is.

998
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,604
It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.

999
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,310
You're not like them.

1000
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,398
Smart kid.

1001
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,985
Give me your hand.

1002
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,410
Do not make me regret this.

1003
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:33,662
I won't.

1004
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,873
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

1005
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:52,472
Where's that tunnel go?

1006
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,182
Under the river.

1007
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,358
Go, go, go, go, go!

1008
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,799
Where did she go?

1009
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,020
I warned you.

1010
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,315
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

1011
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,524
hold your breath.

1012
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,203
- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.

1013
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,623
The Book's through here.

1014
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,066
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

1015
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:54,511
Shit.

1016
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,031
An enchantment
that's specific to me,

1017
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,115
something only I would know.

1018
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,891
- Wait. Stephen.
- Come on.

1019
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,644
Come on.

1020
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,312
Stephen.

1021
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,697
Yeah.

1022
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,659
Thank you.

1023
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,744
Sure.

1024
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,543
Open sesame.

1025
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,201
Come on, kid.

1026
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,037
You got this.

1027
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,081
We got this.

1028
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,543
Yeah.

1029
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,552
You all right?

1030
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:18,845
Yeah.

1031
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,434
This is the Gap Junction,
the space between universes.

1032
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,115
All right, Book.

1033
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,787
Give me what I need.

1034
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,306
No!

1035
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,153
My boys.

1036
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,513
This isn't what your children would want.

1037
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,933
They'll never know.

1038
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,185
Maybe not.

1039
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,769
But you will.

1040
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,983
Oh, no.

1041
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,484
Oh, crap.

1042
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,989
It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

1043
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,115
Yeah.

1044
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:47,368
Or two realities collided.

1045
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,620
Come on.

1046
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:50,788
America doesn't have long.

1047
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,641
So where are we going?

1048
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,834
Well,
if there's still a sanctum

1049
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:55,960
in this universe,

1050
01:26:57,086 --> 01:27:00,632
then there might be
another Other Other Me,

1051
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:03,301
and that's our best shot
of getting back to her.

1052
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:19,108
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about Incursions.

1053
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,654
Whatever happened,

1054
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,907
this universe's you
didn't do a very good job

1055
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,200
of stopping it.

1056
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,462
I'll tell him you said that.

1057
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:40,982
Hello?

1058
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,074
Stop where you are.

1059
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,495
How did you get here?

1060
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:56,581
By accident.

1061
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,584
Who are you?

1062
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:01,627
What are you?

1063
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,796
I'm just one of us.

1064
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,548
From the Multiverse?

1065
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:06,841
That's right.

1066
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,761
Prove it.

1067
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,515
We had a sister.

1068
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,059
Donna.

1069
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:19,937
But she, um...

1070
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,483
She died when we were kids.

1071
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,652
How?

1072
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,826
We were playing
on a frozen lake and, uh...

1073
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,832
she fell through the ice.

1074
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,965
I couldn't save her.

1075
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,844
Sounds about right.

1076
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,974
But we don't talk about that, do we?

1077
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:59,477
No, we don't.

1078
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:03,815
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

1079
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,442
I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...

1080
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,527
Until?

1081
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,905
Until I lost.

1082
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,950
To whom?

1083
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,830
What do you want?

1084
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,083
I just want to get home.

1085
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,835
Yeah? Believe me,

1086
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,879
I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.

1087
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:29,382
Darkhold.

1088
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,301
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

1089
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:33,511
Yeah.

1090
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,179
For good reason.

1091
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,431
That's a start.

1092
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,682
I could use it.

1093
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:39,685
It could help me to communicate
with my universe.

1094
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:40,893
Careful.

1095
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:44,397
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1096
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,400
I don't mean to be callous,

1097
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:50,445
but how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?

1098
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,780
Not just on its reality.

1099
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,407
On its reader.

1100
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:57,493
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,

1101
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,121
but maybe you could help
to save mine.

1102
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,084
Are you happy, Stephen?

1103
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,044
What?

1104
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:12,300
Are you happy, Stephen?

1105
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,554
It's the question that...

1106
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,724
Christine Palmer

1107
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,185
asked me at her wedding.

1108
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,690
I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.

1109
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,067
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

1110
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,945
"What man wouldn't be happy?"

1111
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:38,868
And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house,

1112
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,453
sat down,

1113
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:44,332
and wondered why I'd lied.

1114
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,337
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1115
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,175
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1116
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:59,847
Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.

1117
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,434
But I didn't find it.

1118
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,230
All I found were more of us.

1119
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,567
So I did those Stephens a favor.

1120
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,947
You ever had that dream
where you're falling

1121
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:19,742
as if you've been pushed off
a tall building?

1122
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,622
That was probably me.

1123
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,716
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1124
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,343
Okay.

1125
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,846
All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.

1126
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,431
Here's the deal.

1127
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,393
I'll let you use the Darkhold

1128
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,395
if you give me your Christine.

1129
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:49,438
Yeah.

1130
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:51,607
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1131
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:52,775
No?

1132
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,236
Didn't think so.

1133
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,487
Hang on, we're coming.

1134
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:32,870
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

1135
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,957
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1136
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,376
It's a little bit more
than just Dreamwalking.

1137
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,837
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1138
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,047
I know.

1139
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:46,217
You're right.

1140
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,385
We are all the same.

1141
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:50,930
But right now, that kid needs me.

1142
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:54,683
And I can't do any of this
without your help.

1143
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:56,644
While I'm under,

1144
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,187
I need you to protect my body

1145
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,272
in case they attack me for trespassing.

1146
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:01,774
Who's "they"?

1147
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,736
The souls of the damned.

1148
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:28,968
Okay.

1149
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:33,138
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe,

1150
01:37:33,305 --> 01:37:35,099
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

1151
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,561
Who said they had to be living?

1152
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,219
Stephen Strange,

1153
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:57,097
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

1154
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:58,891
Forbidden.

1155
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:00,476
Trespasser!

1156
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:02,102
Trespasser!

1157
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,733
Cease your Dreamwalk,
or face the eternal consequences.

1158
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:17,743
Stephen!

1159
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,245
They're pulling me down.

1160
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:22,957
Stephen!

1161
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:32,216
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1162
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,009
Where are you?

1163
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,621
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1164
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:14,299
Go back to hell.

1165
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,063
Stephen.

1166
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,858
I've got you.

1167
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:34,445
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1168
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,321
They're spirits.

1169
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:37,448
Use them.

1170
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:43,746
Use them.

1171
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,166
Use them.

1172
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,184
No!

1173
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,114
Come on!

1174
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,787
Uh-oh.

1175
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:37,234
Strange!

1176
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,494
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1177
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:56,211
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me

1178
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,546
to kill me.

1179
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,432
Murderer! Murderer!

1180
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:22,905
I don't even wanna know.

1181
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,253
No!

1182
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,504
- No!
- No!

1183
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:41,381
She's breaking free!

1184
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:42,883
Hold her!

1185
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,469
Strange, take America's power!

1186
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,018
There's no other way.

1187
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:54,978
Yeah.

1188
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,772
This is the only way.

1189
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:12,496
It's me in Other Me's body.

1190
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,253
You're here to take my power,
aren't you?

1191
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,755
Before Wanda can.

1192
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:24,800
It's okay.

1193
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:27,135
I understand now.

1194
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,142
No, America.

1195
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:37,312
I've come here to tell you
to trust yourself.

1196
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:39,064
Trust your power.

1197
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,233
That's how we stop her.

1198
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,485
I can't control it. I...

1199
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:45,570
Yes, you can.

1200
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:47,197
You have been all along.

1201
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,992
Every time you opened a portal,

1202
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,619
you sent us
exactly where we needed to go.

1203
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:56,081
What about the first time?

1204
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,750
Even that led you to this moment...

1205
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:03,422
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

1206
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,070
I've got you.

1207
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:53,305
Uh-huh.

1208
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:55,849
Mm-mm-mm.

1209
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,497
I can't beat you.

1210
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,042
So I'll give you what you want.

1211
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,433
Billy. Tommy.

1212
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,228
Mommy!
It's the witch!

1213
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:42,854
What have you done?

1214
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,106
- Mom!
- Mommy!

1215
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,399
Wait! Boys!

1216
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:46,900
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1217
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
I'm your mother!

1218
01:46:50,612 --> 01:46:52,197
Get away from them.

1219
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,741
Mom!

1220
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,451
No.

1221
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:57,577
Not yet.

1222
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,287
Mommy!

1223
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,265
- Get away from our mom!
- You're not our real mom!

1224
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:03,041
Hey, boys. Stop. Please.

1225
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,977
- Please. Boys, stop it.
- Get out of our house!

1226
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:06,729
- You're not our mom!
- Get out!

1227
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:07,963
- Go away!
- Go!

1228
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,423
Stop it!

1229
01:47:17,722 --> 01:47:19,766
Please don't hurt us.

1230
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,184
Please.

1231
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:23,937
I would never hurt you.

1232
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,105
Never.

1233
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,067
I would never hurt anyone.

1234
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:30,902
I'm not a monster.

1235
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:32,320
I'm a...

1236
01:47:36,199 --> 01:47:37,242
I'm...

1237
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,376
I'm sorry.

1238
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:55,510
Mom!

1239
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,304
- Are you okay?
- Hi.

1240
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,598
Hi. Okay.

1241
01:47:59,764 --> 01:48:00,765
I'm okay.

1242
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:04,269
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1243
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:17,949
- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, Mom. Don't.

1244
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,159
- It's okay.
- Mom.

1245
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:21,036
It's okay. It's okay.

1246
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,204
Know that they'll be loved.

1247
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:46,162
What now?

1248
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:47,664
Get out of here.

1249
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:49,457
I'll find you.

1250
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:00,135
We have to go. Now!

1251
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,441
I opened the Darkhold.

1252
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,444
I have to close it.

1253
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,241
No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.

1254
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,537
You all right?

1255
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,831
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

1256
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,750
Is America okay?

1257
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:15,752
She's on her way here to get us.

1258
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,214
Wanda?

1259
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:22,008
No.

1260
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,853
So she destroyed the Darkhold
in every universe.

1261
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:38,400
She did the right thing.

1262
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,361
Yeah, she did.

1263
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:51,204
What's your universe like?

1264
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:55,458
- It's very beautiful.
- Hmm.

1265
01:51:59,754 --> 01:52:01,423
I wish I could show you.

1266
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:06,845
I'd really like that.

1267
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:14,436
- But I have to go.
- Yeah.

1268
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:16,896
Yeah, I know.

1269
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,110
It's too bad, though.

1270
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:26,322
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

1271
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,202
I love you.

1272
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:37,000
I love you in every universe.

1273
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:42,797
It's not that
I don't wanna care for someone

1274
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,340
or have someone care for me.

1275
01:52:44,507 --> 01:52:45,717
It's just...

1276
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:50,430
I get scared.

1277
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:51,598
Yeah.

1278
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:56,102
Yeah.

1279
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,406
Face your fears...

1280
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:13,077
Doctor Strange.

1281
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:45,151
Ay! How is this so much harder

1282
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:46,778
than a Multiversal portal?

1283
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:51,282
She needs to slow down
and be more patient.

1284
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:55,119
Reminds me of another student I knew.

1285
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:58,957
How you feeling?

1286
01:53:59,582 --> 01:54:00,583
Why do you ask?

1287
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,505
You used the Darkhold
to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1288
01:54:05,588 --> 01:54:06,756
Oh.

1289
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,174
Yeah, right, that.

1290
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:10,176
Fine.

1291
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,305
But I do wanna ask you something.

1292
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:17,225
Are you happy?

1293
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:20,395
That's a, um,

1294
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:21,688
interesting question.

1295
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:26,109
You'd think that saving the world
would get you there,

1296
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:27,986
but it doesn't.

1297
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:35,451
Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.

1298
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,289
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

1299
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,083
Even with its tribulations.

1300
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:46,754
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

1301
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,006
No, we don't.

1302
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:56,514
Hmm.

1303
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:01,144
Wait.

1304
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:04,522
'Sup?

1305
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:05,690
'Sup.

1306
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,318
Made some sparks.

1307
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:09,944
Great.

1308
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,071
Your parents would be proud.

1309
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,240
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

1310
01:55:15,366 --> 01:55:16,409
Stephen.

1311
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:23,333
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1312
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:26,586
So am I, kid.

1313
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:29,964
So am I.

1314
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,084
Hmm.

1315
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,004
Doctor Strange?

1316
01:59:00,424 --> 01:59:01,592
Can I help you?

1317
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,719
You caused an Incursion,

1318
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:05,513
and we're gonna fix it.

1319
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:15,648
Unless you're afraid.

1320
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:21,821
Not in the least.

1321
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:14,567
It's over!
