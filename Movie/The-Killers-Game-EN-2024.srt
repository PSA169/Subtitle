Joseph, I meant to remind you,

44
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:17,961
no blood! The opera house
is 139 years old.

45
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,246
Well, at least
the carpet's red.

46
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,844
What difference
would 10 seconds make?

47
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,211
It can't.

48
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,468
Drop your weapon!

49
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,520
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

50
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:09,249
I got you. Come on.

51
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,791
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

52
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,225
Do you know what happened?

53
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,795
A dangerous world, I guess.

54
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,733
- Is your foot okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,102
Hey.

56
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:27,837
What's your name?

57
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,509
Uh...

58
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,479
Joe.

59
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:34,145
Thank you, Joe.

60
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,816
Are you okay?

61
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:42,456
Hey, are you okay?

62
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:46,221
Hey, do you have water, please?

63
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,494
Please, come.

64
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:44,947
Shit.

65
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,736
Okay, there's nothing here
to indicate any tumors

66
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,090
- so we can rule that out.
- All right.

67
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,682
That is one hell of a resume
you've got there.

68
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,275
Yeah, there's no substitute
for experience.

69
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,649
Yeah.

70
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,785
Is that really necessary?

71
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,687
What, all this
and you're scared of a needle?

72
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:57,289
You don't know what I can do
with that needle.

73
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,258
Man up, soldier.

74
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,692
You know,
in all the years, Joe,

75
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:02,733
how many hits to the head
do you think you've taken?

76
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:03,922
Define hit.

77
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,924
You know, saw stars,
blacked out,

78
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,793
threw up, that kind of thing.

79
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,164
Uh, I never threw up.

80
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,173
Yeah, I guess I've had
my bell rung

81
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,505
- a few times.
- Mm.

82
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:16,943
It's just,
repeated head trauma

83
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:17,803
can lead to CTE

84
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,844
which the scans can't detect.

85
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,682
What are you saying?

86
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:24,978
I'm saying it might be time

87
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,346
to reevaluate your lifestyle,
Sergeant Flood.

88
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,923
- Okay?
- Yeah.

89
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:36,124
I'll run some more tests.

90
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,762
Joseph,
it's 11 o'clock already.

91
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,632
You know I worry
when you're late.

92
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,865
You worry because
worrying is what you do.

93
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,731
I had to see Doc Kagen.
He says hi.

94
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,301
You were wounded?

95
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,871
No, I've been

96
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,273
having these really
bad headaches. I told you.

97
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,342
Doctors.

98
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,008
- What do doctors know?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,917
Well, I've been having
double vision as well, so...

100
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,145
That's bad.

101
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:00,621
In this game, you wouldn't
know what target to shoot.

102
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,687
Are you gonna
drink that coffee

103
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,255
or just stir it to death?

104
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,962
Don't you worry
about my coffee.

105
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,636
So, I spoke to our friend.

106
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,118
The police are working
on a theory

107
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,733
that one of Petrov's
own security team

108
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,235
did the hit. You're clean.

109
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:23,775
Am I?

110
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,240
Are you asking professionally
or philosophically?

111
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,247
I don't know.

112
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,777
Sometimes I ask myself,

113
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,417
"Why the hell do I do this?"

114
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,451
Petrov was scum,
trafficking women.

115
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:35,970
You did the world a favor.

116
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,489
What will they say about me

117
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,319
when someone takes me
off the board?

118
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,093
Will anyone even notice?

119
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:43,661
Leave judgement to God.

120
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,693
Our job is simply
to arrange the meeting.

121
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,264
Now for the good news.

122
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:48,366
What good news?

123
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,602
The $750,000 you just made,

124
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,370
30% to the laundry...

125
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,538
...minus expenses...

126
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:56,207
Gonna buy you
a new calculator.

127
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,876
Minus my commission.

128
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,714
Cheap at half the price.

129
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,549
We're gonna need to talk
about some of these expenses.

130
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,849
You need a vacation.

131
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,686
Get some sun.
Meet a nice girl.

132
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,572
Where am I
gonna meet a nice girl?

133
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,458
Who knows
where you'll meet her?

134
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,693
Just get me another gig.

135
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,562
Joseph, never get
so busy making a living

136
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,862
that you forget
to make a life.

137
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,967
Did you read that

138
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:26,072

Thanks.

Hey.

150
00:11:58,603 --> 00:11:59,865
- Hi.
- Hey.

151
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,487
- Joe?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,863
- Yeah.
- Hi.

153
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,941
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I had that.

154
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,444
You've had this
this whole time?

155
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,514
Yeah.

156
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,385
Wow, you really
are a lifesaver.

157
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:13,715
First time I've heard that.

158
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,151
Well, you saved mine.

159
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:18,756
How's your foot?

160
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,025
It's good. It's nothing.
Just a little bruised.

161
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,612
Can I buy you dinner?

162
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,164
You know, just as a...
as a thank you.

163
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,703
Um...

164
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:33,033
Unless you can't because...
because you can't.

165
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,634
No, it's not that.
It's just...

166
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,621
Okay. I'll just
give you my number.

167
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,609
I have to get back

168
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,144

00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:06,924
No.

183
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:10,233
'Sup, girl?

184
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,306
No.

185
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,371
It's Joe.

186
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,946
I'd love to.

187
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,245
Send.

188
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,287
Mmm.

189
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:30,553
Mmm.

190
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:32,752
Where do you put it all?

191
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,729
Before we started the show,

192
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,095
we were rehearsing
eight hours a day.

193
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:41,834
Now we're at four hours a day,
six shows a week.

194
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:44,597
I cannot do that
on celery and rice cakes.

195
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,600
How'd you end up in Budapest?

196
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,374
Milos, she's one of the best
choreographers in the world.

197
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,472
Yeah.

198
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,373
The show was incredible
up until...

199
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,327
- The murder and shooting?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,281
That wasn't
in the program notes.

201
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,949
How did you end up here?

202
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,550
I don't run into
many Americans.

203
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,192
Work.

204
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,056
I travel all over Europe

205
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:10,491
and this was central,
affordable, low-key.

206
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,691
You got family?

207
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,699
Uh...

208
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,934
I joined the army
when I was 18.

209
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:19,302
I'm not sure
anybody noticed when I left.

210
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:21,638
I didn't think to remind them.

211
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,075
What do you do now?

212
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:25,110
Retirement planning.

213
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,912
What?

214
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:28,548
Could you help a dancer
who needs to retire soon?

215
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,149
You're too young to retire.

216
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,749
Dancers are like boxers.

217
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,014
Father Time
remains undefeated.

218
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,215
Don't you love dancing?

219
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:37,723
The last 10 years,
two ankle surgeries

220
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:39,755
torn ligaments,
stress fractures.

221
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:40,954
I'm not complaining.

222
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,392
I love dance. I really do.

223
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,261
My mom had to work two jobs
to afford my ballet classes

224
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:50,065
so to me, it could
never be just a hobby.

225
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,563
So I was thinking
when I retire

226
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:54,201
I could start a dance school
for kids like me.

227
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:55,773
A place where
they get to decide

228
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:57,538
who they really want to be.

229
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,147
It all sounds
a bit too crazy, but...

230
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:03,709
I don't think so.

231
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,482
No. I think it sounds perfect.

232
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,639
Well, if that doesn't work out,

233
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,093
I can always become
a cat burglar.

234
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,829
I'll need
a good getaway driver.

235
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,913
Mm. That seems risky.
Any benefits?

236
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,997
Me in a cat suit, duh!

237
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,599
Where do I send
my application?

238
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,048
Did you just laugh?

239
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,430
- No.
- You did.

240
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,068
- I definitely did not.
- You did.

241
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,707
You're smiling right now.

242
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,671
- Am I?
- It suits you.

243
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,442
- Maybe.
- It really does.

Table dancer?

273
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,306
No. Come on.

274
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:46,940
It's ballet.
She's a dancer at the Bolshoi.

275
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,575
- She got a name?
- Yeah, her name's Maize.

276
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,713
Maize? Does Maize know
what you do?

277
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,985
I don't think
I can tell her, Zvi.

278
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,451
Are you serious about her?

279
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,988
Yeah, serious enough
to get out of the game

280
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:00,390
before she finds out.

281
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,442
There's two ways out
of The Killer's Game, Joseph.

282
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,770
You walk away clean
or you go out on your back.

283
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,098
There's a lot of people

284
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,596
who would like
to see me slabbed.

285
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:13,338
Still with the headaches?
What did Doc Kagen say?

286
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,375
Still waiting on test results.

287
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,838
You play by the rules.

288
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,815
You never took a mark
that didn't have it coming.

289
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,548
No kids,
no innocent bystanders.

290
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:27,715
You want to walk.

291
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,324
We can make it happen.

292
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,359
Then I'm out.

293
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:45,769
I was also thinking I should
get a life insurance policy.

294
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,270
Joe, come on.

295
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,039
Guys like us don't have
life insurance policies.

296
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,273
Do I even have to say it?

297
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,944
We don't need
some claims adjuster

298
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,511
sniffing around our business.

299
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:58,013
I know. Can you just make
something look good on paper?

300
00:19:58,014 --> 00:19:59,815
Fake it. For Maize.

301
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:00,984
Very well.

302
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:03,419
And, uh, I got a favor to ask.

303
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,226
- Oh, now there's a favor.
- Yeah.

304
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,193
So Maize wants to have
a birthday dinner for me

305
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:10,956
and I told her
I'd invite friends.

306
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,992
I thought you and Sharon
might want to...

307
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:15,528
Yeah.

308
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,304
- Be delighted.
- All right. Thank you.

309
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:05,896
Uh-uh.

310
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,248
S'il vous plait!

311
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,466
- Maize.
- Yes?

312
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,683
I've known Joseph
for 20 years.

313
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:14,485
He's the most private person
I know.

314
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,324
And I know this.

315
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,662
He's crazy about you.

316
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,798
- Trust me, it's mutual.
- Right.

317
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,601
Men need looking after
in every area of their lives.

318
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:31,109
They don't know it,
but they do.

319
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,341
You need to be
a chef in his kitchen,

320
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,979
an accountant with the books,

321
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,147
a lady in the streets,

322
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:39,314
and a freak in his bed!

323
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,478
Sharon, Sharon.

324
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,646
Don't be a shonda.

325
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,664
Please leave
the poor girl alone.

326
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:45,559
No, Zvi.
I'm taking notes, please.

327
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,454
- Sharon, anything else?
- Yeah!

328
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:48,721
Why are you encouraging her?

329
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:49,988
It makes her happy. Look.

330
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,657
If you've done something bad,
wrecked his motor...

331
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,329
- Okay.
- ...give him a blow job!

332
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,047
If it's really bad, swallow.

333
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,292
And if it's
really, really bad,

334
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:01,536
let him pop it
in the tradesman's.

335
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,535
Did you just tell me
to take it in the ass?

336
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,776
- Bless.
- She did.

337
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:07,980
After that,
you can tell him

338
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:09,214
you've murdered
their mother...

339
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:10,280
- Right.
- ...cut her throat.

340
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,146
They won't care.

341
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,777
What'd I miss?

342
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:15,748
Oh, Joe.
Sharon was just giving me

343
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:18,322
- some very insightful advice.
- Uh-oh.

344
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:19,887
- I'll show you later.
- Okay.

345
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,453
- Maybe. If you want.
- Joseph...

346
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:22,794
We are surrounded.

347
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,325
I surrender.

348
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,711
- I surrender with you.
- Yes?

349
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,021
- We give up.
- We surrender.

350
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:30,095
I can see
why you're retiring.

351
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:35,837
Boychik, if you're
getting serious with Maize

352
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,540
tell her what you do.
All of it.

353
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,076
I told Sharon everything
very early on.

354
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,612
If Maize loves you,
she'll understand.

355
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,085
You played by the rules.
Women respect integrity.

356
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,669
If she finds out later,

357
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,253
the trust you built,

358
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,722
it's gone.

359
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,061
♪ Happy birthday ♪

360
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,095
♪...to you ♪

361
00:22:58,096 --> 00:22:59,790
I forgot it was your birthday.

362
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,933
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

363
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,400
Oh, man.

364
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:10,838
♪ Happy birthday, dear Joe ♪

365
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:16,276
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

366
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:20,684
Wait, make a wish.
Make a wish.

367
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:24,924
Okay.

368
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:29,791
We got the results
from those tests.

369
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,729
I'm afraid
I've got some bad news, Joe.

370
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:37,063
You have
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

371
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,638
It's a neurodegenerative
disorder.

372
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,542
Which means what exactly?

373
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:49,207
It means rapid
motor-neuron disintegration

374
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:52,210
leading to a loss
of coordination.

375
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,936
Severe headaches, blindness,

376
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:56,654
and diminished
mental capacity.

377
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,023
- Are you positive?
- Yeah.

378
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,563
I had the sample tested
by three separate labs

379
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:09,347
and I got the same result.

380
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,131
Now, I'm going
to order some more tests.

381
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,542
Okay.

382
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:19,938
So what am I looking at?

383
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,206
Chemo? Something like that?

384
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Hm.

385
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,078
There is no cure.

386
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:32,225
The first step should be to
get you into palliative care

387
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,821
and the sooner
we begin treatment,

388
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:36,025
the more comfortable
we can make this for you,

389
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,090
okay?

390
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:45,571
How long do I have?

391
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,575
Best case, three months.

392
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,205
Things will
deteriorate quickly,

393
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,748
but there are things we can do
to make it easier.

394
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,851
Turn me into a vegetable
while I wait to die.

395
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:05,151
I don't think so. No.

396
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,287
If you need some therapy,

397
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:11,242
some counseling...

398
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,290
No.

399
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:14,763
No, I'm good.

400
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,196
From my end,
Joe, I'm really sorry.

401
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:19,236
I really am.

402
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:33,282
"CJD early symptoms, anxiety,
depression, loss of balance,

403
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,617
"speech impairments,

404
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,789
"involuntary movement,
shaking hands..."

405
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:12,612
Shit!

406
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:14,249
Joseph.

407
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,886
I wasn't expecting you.

408
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,127
Are you okay?
You look kind of...

409
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:22,354
I need someone retired.

410
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:24,722
I need a nice, clean job.

411
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,793
What? What is...

412
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,233
Sorry, what's the matter
with you?

413
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,427
Who's getting retired?

414
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,135
Me.

415
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:33,402
I'm the target.

416
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,767
I'll pay. Don't worry.

417
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:36,135
The going rate, two million.

418
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:39,005
Can you explain to me
exactly what is going on?

419
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:42,715
I got a disease.
You know, the headaches.

420
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:46,015
I'm... I'm getting
the shakes and...

421
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:50,118
and it's gonna take me out.

422
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:58,290
Here's a little
over a half a million

423
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,425
in mixed currency
and gold coins.

424
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:05,296
I want you
to liquidate everything else.

425
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:07,834
It all goes to Maize
through the life insurance.

426
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:11,037
No, Joseph. This is madness.

427
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,779
The life insurance won't
pay out for a suicide.

428
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,174
She has to believe it.

429
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,414
So I'll pay you
to assign an assassin.

430
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:20,753
You choose who.

431
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:22,252
No.

432
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,691
This is what we do.
We go to every doctor.

433
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:29,193
If they say it's hopeless,
we go up the mountain,

434
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:30,490
find a shaman.

435
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,830
Zvi...

436
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:35,993
I've lived by the sword.

437
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:37,998
I want to go out the same way.

438
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,900
You want to fight,
you fight for your life.

439
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:42,907
I can't fight if I'm blind...

440
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:47,271
staggering around
like a drunk, shitting myself.

441
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,941
I don't want Maize
to see me like that.

442
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,242
You know what I think?

443
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,681
I think you want
to protect her from the truth

444
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,245
of who you really are.

445
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:58,549
Zvi, I'm asking you
for your help.

446
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,387
- I'd do the same for you.
- That's some comfort. Thanks.

447
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,159
It's what I've decided.

448
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,729
I'll see your wishes
are carried out

449
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,961
to the very last dot.

450
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:12,735
But get one thing straight.

451
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:15,571
There is no way
on this fucking earth

452
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:18,170
I'm ordering a hit on you.

453
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,209
Not for two million,
not for 22 million.

454
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:36,422
Thank you.

455
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:12,259
What brings Joe Flood
to my door?

456
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:30,247
I need a contract executed.

457
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,052
Go talk to your rabbi.

458
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:34,081
I did.

459
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,480
He turned me down.
Conflict of interest.

460
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:39,922
Joe, if you were covered
in napalm burning alive

461
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,894
I wouldn't piss on you
to put you out.

462
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,626
Perfect.

463
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:45,095
I've come to the right place.

464
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:51,431
Max, you know Joe Flood, right?

465
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,967
Best assassin in Europe.

466
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:56,370
Joe, do you know
my bodyguard, Max?

467
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:13,737
Hiring war criminals
as security? Classy.

468
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,959
Flood here
handcuffed my father

469
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,228
to the steering wheel
of his Mercedes,

470
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,559
drove him into the sea.

471
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,036
He was a good assassin,
but your father transgressed.

472
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,566
He broke
the rules of the game.

473
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,207
I should have Max put one
in your head right now.

474
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:33,603
Mon plaisir.

475
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:37,114
Wait a few hours, Max,
and earn your two million.

476
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,054
You're talking in riddles.
Who do you want retired?

477
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:45,987
Me.

478
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,387
All these years,
you couldn't touch me

479
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,453
because I was always
on the right side of the game.

480
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,430
Now I'm paying you
for the green light.

481
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,295
Why not do it yourself?

482
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,162
Maybe this was a mistake.

483
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,962
I'm sorry to waste your time.

484
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,634
No, no, no.

485
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:02,469
Please, sit down.

486
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,143
Two million?

487
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:07,980
I want it done clean.

488
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:10,608
My account in Bermuda.

489
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,884
- I know you're good for it.
- Who are you thinking of?

490
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:15,851
Honestly, it depends
on who's available.

491
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:18,419
But they'll be the very best.

492
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,486
- Thank you.
- The pleasure's mine.

493
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:25,290
I've thought about
doing this for years.

494
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,795
Might have risked it
if it wasn't

495
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:28,798
professional suicide.

496
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,535
This way,
I kill you and get paid.

497
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,737
It gets me wet.

498
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:37,438
Whatever turns you on.

499
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:41,640
Give me till 2400 hours.

500
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,878
The clock starts at midnight.

501
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,579
You're the client, Mr. Flood.

502
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:02,196
Hmm.

503
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:06,302
Now, who's available
in the Assassin app?

504
00:33:10,742 --> 00:33:12,308
Mm.

505
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:18,083

With inflation

516
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:58,354
Hard pass.

517
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:03,457
Boo, Lovedahl. Aw.

518
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:08,025

Hey! Delivery request!

535
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:08,520
- Two million!
- That's real money.

536
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:09,719
Let's split!

537
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:39,614
Hey.

538
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:44,286
Hey.

539
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:47,450
Gotcha.

540
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,529
- Hi!
- Hey.

541
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:56,779
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

542
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,996
- Are you having headaches?
- Yeah.

543
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,735
What's going on?

544
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:03,704
You're tired?

545
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,706
You seem anxious.

546
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:09,380
I have to tell you something.

547
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,581
I've got to tell you
something too.

548
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,355
I have to leave town
for a few weeks.

549
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,424
I'm not sure I'm coming back.

550
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,262
What?

551
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:24,593
That...

552
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,299
What does that mean?

553
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:31,067
I need to take a step back

554
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,865
and reassess
what I really want.

555
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,519
You're talking crazy.

556
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,639
We make each other happy.

557
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,707
No, we need a break.

558
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:44,276
A break means
breaking up, Joe.

559
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,812
What is going on?

560
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:49,350
I know when I love someone,
and I know when they love me.

561
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,949
So what is there
to back away from?

562
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:55,187
- It's over, Maize.
- What?

563
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:56,559
It has to be.

564
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,793
Soon this will all
make perfect sense.

565
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,500
Why? Why?

566
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:05,869
I'm sorry.

567
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,345
Here. Remember me this way.

568
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,387
When you're on your deathbed,
remember what you had

569
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:25,918
and what you threw away.

570
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:30,827
I will.

but I'm speaking the truth.

577
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:25,613

I'll be gone.

Maize...

582
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,837
I'm drunk right now, but...

583
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:53,973
I want you to know
that I'm speaking the truth.

00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:57,977
By the time you get this,
I'll be gone.

585
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,513
I've got Creutzfeldt...

586
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:02,679
I can't even say it, Maize.

587
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,017
I've got a brain disorder

588
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,018
and it's gonna kill me.

589
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,824
Maize, the only thing
I want you to understand

590
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:15,628
is it's you I've been
looking for my entire life.

591
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:18,298
You make me free.
You make me...

592
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:19,867
You make me feel...

593
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:24,542
Shit.

594
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:39,386
Maize...

595
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:41,118
I'm drunk right now, but...

596
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,825
I want you to know
that I'm speaking the truth.

597
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:00,572
Oh, Flood. Thank God.

598
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:01,972
There's been a mistake.

599
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:05,282
You do not have
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

600
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:06,946
But they tested me
multiple times.

601
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,745
Yeah, they switched labels
with another patient

602
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:10,221
and that poor bastard

603
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:12,149
definitely has
Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

604
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,691
It was the wrong barcode
on the wrong test tube.

605
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,856
I think you should consider
a lawsuit against the lab.

606
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:19,228
What about my headaches
and double vision?

607
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,429
It's a bit of a mystery.

608
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,626
Have you had
your eyes checked?

609
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:23,231
- My eyes?
- Flood,

610
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:24,633
you're not going to die.

611
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:26,786
In fact, there's nothing
on earth to stop you

612
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,940
from leading
a long and healthy life,

613
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:30,267
so go and do it.

614
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:34,174
Give me till 2400 hours.
The clock starts at midnight.

615
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:38,880
Uh, Doc, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

616
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,189
♪ Are you ready, let's go ♪

617
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:35,673
Ah.

618
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,219
Goyang, this was a mistake.

619
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,951
I'm canceling the contract.

620
00:43:22,952 --> 00:43:24,921
Fuck you!

621
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:26,891
That's not how it works!

622
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,075
Mm.

623
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,146
You should've walked.

624
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,155
I got you.

625
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:02,164
Sorry,

626
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:03,432
my Korean's a little rusty.

627
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,942
You're calling
from Heaven or Hell?

628
00:47:05,943 --> 00:47:08,806
Goyang's been retired.
I'm canceling the contract.

629
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:10,109
Love to oblige,

630
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,442
but events have gathered
a momentum of their own.

631
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:14,749
I'll pay a penalty charge.
I'll take a hit.

632
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,535
You're going to take a hit.

633
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:18,321
Look, keep the two mil.

634
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:20,869
Just cancel the contract.

635
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,591
I'm obligated to see to it

636
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:24,455
that the client's wishes
are met.

637
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:27,061
Yeah, I'm the client,
and I'm telling you to cancel.

638
00:47:27,062 --> 00:47:29,527
That's only if this phone call
ever happened.

639
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:31,427
You killed my father,

640
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,796
and he loved you like the son
he never had.

641
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:36,166
Let me tell you something
about your father.

642
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,170
I couldn't stand that prick.

643
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,822
Antoinette, I don't
often enjoy my work

644
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,473
but that one,
that was a real pleasure.

645
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:46,246
You think a Korean barbeque
changes anything?

646
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,984
It changes nothing!
I'm sending this one out wide.

647
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:52,049
I'm calling in every hitter
in Europe,

648
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,455
you hear me?

649
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:54,449
I'm calling in

650
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,592
every motherfucking killer
with a shiv

651
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:58,190
from Istanbul to Dublin!

652
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,944
Yeah. Well, you tell them
to pack light

653
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:03,699
because they won't fucking
be staying long.

654
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:18,680
Hello, leave me
a message.

655
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:20,684
Maize, I'm in trouble.

656
00:48:20,685 --> 00:48:22,333
I'll explain to you
when I see you.

657
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:23,790
It's not safe for you
to go home.

658
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,354
I'm gonna send you some money.

659
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:26,919
Use it
to go wherever you want.

660
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,417
Just get out of Budapest.

661
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:29,992
And don't tell me
where you're going.

662
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,728
I'll find you. Wherever
you go, wherever you are,

663
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:34,798
I will find you. I swear it.

664
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:36,439
And stay off your phone.

665
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:42,833
Guess who, motherfucker!

666
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,153
- Hey, Zoli.
- Hey, Flood.

667
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:48,014
Where's your dumbass brother?

668
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,875
He's right behind you.

669
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,578
You serve, I spike!

670
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,488
One point!

671
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:06,998
Hey, bro, serve it up!

672
00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:13,798
Hey, Flood! This is business.
Nothing personal.

673
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:26,530
You know
how the game works, Flood.

674
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,278
Yeah, I know how it works.

675
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:34,854
That was business.

676
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:36,252
This is personal.

677
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,142
Zoli!

678
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,387
You bastard!

679
00:49:41,632 --> 00:49:43,628
- That was my brother!
- One!

680
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:47,203
Come on!

681
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,169
- Come on!
- Fuck you!

682
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,526
Putain.

683
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:16,796
I'm going to expand
the field of vendors.

684
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:17,865
How wide?

685
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:19,197
Double Supreme.

686
00:50:19,198 --> 00:50:20,431
That's going
to be expensive.

687
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:23,871
When I want your opinion,
I'll tell you.

688
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:25,239
I'll spend my own money.

689
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,639
Don't care what cutthroats
crawl out the woodwork.

690
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:31,478
I want Joe Flood dead.

Just as well.

Maize, I'm in trouble.

729
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,089
I'll explain to you
when I see you.

730
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,166
It's not safe for you
to go home. I'm gonna

731
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,497
- send you some money.
- What?

732
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:53,028
Use it to go
wherever you want.

733
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:54,835
Just get out of Budapest.

734
00:55:54,836 --> 00:55:56,800
Don't tell me where you're going.
I'll find you.

735
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,751
Wherever you go,
wherever you are,

736
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:01,198
I will find you. I swear.

737
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:21,360
Quick, get inside.

738
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,526
I've been expecting you.

739
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,402
- You weren't followed?
- No.

740
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:27,471
Oy gevalt, look at you.

741
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,110
Who is it, Zvi?

742
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:38,141
It's Joseph, Sharon.
Go to sleep.

743
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:41,782
- Does he know what time it is?
- Yes, dear. He owns a watch.

744
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:46,047
Should I make him
something to eat?

745
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:49,454
Hey, Sharon. No, thanks.
Kinda lost my appetite.

746
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:51,055
Let's get you fixed up.

747
00:56:53,392 --> 00:56:54,894
You were on the news.

748
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,399
Five dead Koreans.

749
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,998
Yeah. They came at me
at 12:00 on the dot.

750
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:02,601
You went to Antoinette's?

751
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:05,709
- Yeah, you said no.
- I said, "Fight."

752
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:08,842
The doctors fucked up.

753
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,482
You were right.
What do they know?

754
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,547
I'm gonna live.

755
00:57:13,548 --> 00:57:16,033
I'd say that's up
in the air right now.

756
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:18,519
Yeah, she's still angry
about her old man.

757
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,923
Some people
take things so personal.

758
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,326
There's only one way
out of this.

759
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,494
You kill Antoinette,
that's a violation.

760
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:30,465
She's simply facilitating
your own stupid request.

761
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:32,047
No, I want her
to think I'm running.

762
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,630
I'm gonna bring them all
into one place

763
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:34,798
and take them all out.

764
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,803
She'll have to lift
the contract.

765
00:57:36,804 --> 00:57:38,809
She put
the call out wide.

766
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,409
Double Supreme.

767
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,544
Double Supreme?
I only gave her two mil.

768
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,977
She's serious
about delivering.

769
00:57:45,978 --> 00:57:49,520
Zvi, that bag of cash,
you gotta get that to Maize.

770
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:51,619
And I'm gonna need a gun.

771
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,018
Well, I don't have one here.

772
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:57,623
Joseph, I schedule retirements
these days.

773
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:59,563
I don't actually
make them happen.

774
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,994
You don't have anything?

775
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:09,100
Oh, man.

776
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:21,513
Explosives? That's it?

777
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:23,447
Leftover from the Mehrabi job.

778
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:24,951
That was you?

779
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:28,083
Fourteen personal bodyguards,
the entire Moroccan Police

780
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,490
and the French DGSE
watching his back

781
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,894
and he asks, "Was that you?"

782
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:36,258
Wow.

783
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:38,311
All right. Well, if we're
gonna bring them all to me,

784
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,364
we gotta be slick.
They can't think it's a setup.

785
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:41,602
Please.

786
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:43,671
I was dropping the KGB
onto false trails

787
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,536
when you were getting trapped
by training bras.

788
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:47,073
I've got salt beef.

789
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:48,610
You like salt beef.

790
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:51,573
- Now, don't say you don't.
- I do love salt beef.

791
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:52,642
So, where?

792
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:53,877
You remember that place

793
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,553
where we held
the diplomat's son?

794
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:56,887
Mmm.

795
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:15,999
- Speak.
- I'll keep it brief.

796
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,402
Flood took out a contract
on his own life.

797
00:59:18,403 --> 00:59:19,907
Classy.

798
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:22,179
He's making it a lot harder
on everyone than he should.

799
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,173
The brother is intractable.

800
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:28,280
Flood has a girlfriend.
I'm gonna send some data.

801
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:31,784
Nice. The man has taste.

802
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,658
Make sure he doesn't
leave Budapest alive.

803
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:37,327
I'm giving you an edge.

804
00:59:37,328 --> 00:59:40,659
In exchange,
I need a little favor.

805
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,597
Your driver, he's my cousin.

806
00:59:42,598 --> 00:59:45,168
I'm trying to mentor him
into the business.

807
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:47,064
I promised my late uncle.

808
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:50,106
Could you look after him?
He's a bit green.

809
00:59:50,107 --> 00:59:51,266
I'd appreciate it.

810
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:54,109
For you, mistress,
but he mustn't cramp my style.

811
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,210
I'm working.

812
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:56,713
Gros bisous.

813
00:59:58,609 --> 00:59:59,742
Yo!

814
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,949
You my man, The Lovedog!

815
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,384
It's Lovedahl.

816
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:06,055
Love. Dahl.

817
01:00:06,056 --> 01:00:07,455
Practice repeatedly.

818
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:09,390
Like Dahl.
Like curry and dem, man.

819
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:10,491
Yeah, yeah. I hear that.

820
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:12,123
You cannot
be Queen Bitch's cousin.

821
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:16,760
Yeah, bruv! I be dem Money,
and this be your ride, G.

822
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,995
I asked for a luxury car.

823
01:00:17,996 --> 01:00:19,735
I don't even know
what the fuck that is.

824
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:22,469
Yeah, bruv. No, this
a luxury car, man. It's a BM.

825
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,086
Take my shit and let's go.

826
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,031
You want me to take your bag?

827
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:27,975
Take my shit...

828
01:00:27,976 --> 01:00:30,139
- and get in the fucking car!
- Yeah, it's cool.

829
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,941
Man, jump in the car,
I'll cut the AC

830
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,746
and that long journey, bruv.

831
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:36,317
You relax, man.
This is a heavy bag.

832
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:38,486
It's expensive, too.

833
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:39,882
Damn, it smells
like fish in here.

834
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:41,417
It's dank cologne, bruv.

835
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:47,324
Shut this shit off!

836
01:00:54,768 --> 01:00:56,331
Stop, Sharon.

837
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:59,407
You'll kill the poor man.
You'll snap his neck.

838
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:00,805
I know what I'm doing.

839
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,609
You met me
in a massage parlor.

840
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,159
I didn't go there
for a massage.

841
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,709
Yeah, well...

842
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,283
that's your mistake.

843
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,524
You've paralyzed
the poor man.

844
01:01:24,136 --> 01:01:25,230
Oh, my God.

845
01:01:27,404 --> 01:01:28,919
Oh, my God.

846
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,435
I can see clearly.

847
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:33,704
My headache's gone!

848
01:01:35,823 --> 01:01:38,051
Sharon, you're a saint!

849
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:40,281
You're a s... Oh, my God!

850
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,485
- Joseph. Joe...
- Oh, my God!

851
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:45,385
I'll never hear the end of it.

852
01:01:45,386 --> 01:01:46,785
You're welcome.

853
01:01:48,185 --> 01:01:50,427
Fucking gold, bruv!

854
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:53,255
Wicked track,
filthy bars, yeah?

855
01:01:53,256 --> 01:01:55,766
I thought I told you
to turn that shit off?

856
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:57,432
All right.

857
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,170
Make it all sad and that
in here,

858
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:01,702
real tense and that.

859
01:02:01,703 --> 01:02:03,235
So you want in the game?

860
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:05,605
Hell, yeah, bruv. Yeah, man.

861
01:02:05,606 --> 01:02:07,643
- Of course.
- Why?

862
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,775
They don't call me "Money"
for no reason, G.

863
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:12,163
Make them stacks, yeah.

864
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:14,890
There's a lot of ways
to make money.

865
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:17,618
But this shit here,
it's an artform.

866
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:19,688
- A calling.
- Yeah, mate.

867
01:02:19,689 --> 01:02:21,488
I've been training for this
all my life.

868
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:22,589
- Really?
- Yeah.

869
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:26,395
Guns, knives, Muay Thai, JKD.

870
01:02:26,396 --> 01:02:28,727
I'm hard as nails, bruv.

871
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:30,795
I'm stone cold motherfucker!

872
01:02:30,796 --> 01:02:32,580
- Give me that.
- But that's...

873
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:34,365
Before you shoot
your dick off.

874
01:02:34,366 --> 01:02:36,733
That's my strap still, bruv.

875
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:38,908
All right. Cool.

876
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:41,341
Yeah, bruv, listen, see.

877
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:43,107
Man, me and you, yeah,

878
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:45,845
we can be like
the new dynamic duo, yeah?

879
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,583
You know, like Eminem
and 50 Cent, bruv.

880
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:50,432
Starsky and Hutch.

881
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,281
You know?
Like Crockett and Tubbs.

882
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:54,052
We could be like the guys
from Miami Vice.

883
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,117
We could be
the Corleone brothers.

884
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:56,794
Shut the fuck up, will you?

885
01:02:57,725 --> 01:02:59,456
Just a minute, please.

886
01:03:05,534 --> 01:03:06,562
Ooh.

887
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,571
You done good-good, Flood.

888
01:03:09,572 --> 01:03:10,868
Hey, who are you
staring at, bruv?

889
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:12,568
Shut the fuck up, please.

890
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,441
Please.

891
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:34,865
Joe.

892
01:03:35,498 --> 01:03:36,867
Who are you?

893
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:43,836
Hey, now, baby girl.

894
01:03:43,837 --> 01:03:45,705
I'm an old friend
of Joe Flood's.

895
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:46,906
He sent me to collect you.

896
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,172
I don't know
what you're talking about.

897
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:50,713
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Now, this is way too public

898
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:52,077
for the conversation
we need to have.

899
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,211
Yeah, see, we got a whip
waiting for you, sister.

900
01:03:54,212 --> 01:03:55,783
We're gonna take you
to see Mr. Flood.

901
01:03:55,784 --> 01:03:57,013
Oh, shit!

902
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:58,484
Goddamn!

903
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,084
Fucking hell!

904
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:03,006
Get in the car!

905
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,928
And stop fucking
bleeding everywhere!

906
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:08,030
Fucking hell. You good, yeah?

907
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:09,861
All right.

908
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:32,954
You were right.

909
01:04:32,955 --> 01:04:35,083
His old handler
is trying to set up an out.

910
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,692
Where?

911
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:38,395
Some old castle
on the mountain road

912
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:39,624
between here and Prague.

913
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,928
For sure?

914
01:04:40,929 --> 01:04:42,565
He tried to hide it all,
but his tech isn't quite

915
01:04:42,566 --> 01:04:43,732
as good as ours.

916
01:04:43,733 --> 01:04:45,162
Zvi stopped with tech
around the time

917
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:47,336
the digital clock
was invented.

918
01:04:47,337 --> 01:04:48,970
Maximilious,

919
01:04:48,971 --> 01:04:51,534
notify the hitters
and call up your mercenaries.

920
01:04:51,535 --> 01:04:55,172
Joe Flood might think he can
hold off a few assassins

921
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:57,475
but he can't fight
an army too.

922
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:06,656
Oh, fuck me!

923
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:07,983
Here we go.

924
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:09,668
Location update.

925
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:11,353
Schatzberger Castle.

926
01:05:11,354 --> 01:05:12,824
It's a fucking stupid name,
isn't it?

927
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:16,828
- How's the drive?
- Scenic.

928
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,460
Your plan worked.

929
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,869
Antoinette posted
the change of location.

930
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,400
- It's a free-for-all.
- Four million for all.

931
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,476
Nobody in my stable
will touch it,

932
01:05:26,477 --> 01:05:27,841
even for four million.

933
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,206
You must be loved.

934
01:05:29,207 --> 01:05:31,341
Your old friend Lovedahl
took the bait.

935
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:33,984
Four million
buys a lot of vinyl.

936
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:10,581
Sweetheart, what do you really
know about Flood?

937
01:06:11,282 --> 01:06:14,282
That he's kind and gentle.

938
01:06:14,283 --> 01:06:17,824
Gentle?
Your lover-man has been,

939
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:19,456
for the last 20 years,

940
01:06:19,457 --> 01:06:22,558
the most prolific
professional hitman in Europe.

941
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,361
You need a job done right,
give it to Joe.

942
01:06:25,362 --> 01:06:28,335
Joe Flood,
more hits than Motown.

943
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:32,669
Then you better hope
he doesn't find you.

944
01:06:33,104 --> 01:06:34,602
Baby girl...

945
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:38,213
I got four million reasons
why I need him to.

946
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:49,284
Mm.

947
01:08:16,747 --> 01:08:18,361
Come on.

948
01:08:22,115 --> 01:08:23,846
Shh!

949
01:08:31,853 --> 01:08:34,222
What's the matter?
Things slow at the pub?

950
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:56,716
Filthy dog!

951
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,071
Angus!

952
01:09:04,022 --> 01:09:05,228
Come on!

953
01:09:15,297 --> 01:09:16,602
What's that smell?

954
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:20,641
Let's smash the cunt!

955
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:30,682
The cable's kinked, brother!

956
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:38,072
That's right!

957
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,201
Bullseye, you bastard!

958
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:46,701
It's gonna be like that here?

959
01:09:46,702 --> 01:09:48,569
Yeah, come on!

960
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:03,915
Incoming!

961
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:07,389
Fuck!

962
01:10:12,428 --> 01:10:14,462
It looks like
the party's already started.

963
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:16,233
Shit.

964
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:18,568
I forgot the gifts.

965
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:19,764
No, we didn't.

966
01:10:22,369 --> 01:10:23,803
Ah, nice work, brother!

967
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,238
Jesus, what'd you kick me for?

968
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:26,823
I kicked you
so that I could kick him.

969
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:28,501
- You were in the way.
- I bloody had him,

970
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:29,972
- and you ruined it!
- You had him?

971
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:31,474
- Thank you very much!
- Finish him off then!

972
01:10:31,475 --> 01:10:32,977
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Mess with the bull...

973
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:35,851
Fuck!

974
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:43,421
...you get the horn.

975
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:46,020
Angus! I've got
a serious itch here.

976
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:48,324
You'll be all right, Rory.
It's just a scratch, lad.

977
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:49,797
Fuck.

978
01:10:49,798 --> 01:10:52,566
Rory! Fuck!

979
01:10:54,468 --> 01:10:56,171
That's my brother
you just killed.

980
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:59,069
You're gonna pay for that,
you fucking twat!

981
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,623
Showtime!

982
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,850
Hey, Flood! I heard you're
looking for a good time.

983
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:42,316
How about a little G&T?

984
01:11:42,317 --> 01:11:44,801
Appreciate the offer,
but that's not my drink.

985
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:47,286
Oh, we cater
to everyone's tastes, baby.

986
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:49,018
Maybe a lap dance, instead?

987
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,934
Oh, Flood,
you're such a tease!

988
01:11:58,935 --> 01:12:00,535
Shot your wad, big boy?

989
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:14,345
I hate to see you go,

990
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:16,515
but I love to watch you leave.

991
01:12:22,728 --> 01:12:23,841
Bloody hell!

992
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:30,664

Whoo! She got

What's a flank, bruv?

1015
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:53,836
Just go on down there.

1016
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:56,256
What, like this way
on the right?

1017
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:58,334
- On the right.
- Right. Okay.

1018
01:14:58,335 --> 01:15:00,541
Tell me what you see.

1019
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,747
Big fucking house, yo!

1020
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,982
What you're seeing is a trap.

1021
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,484
Anyone goes in that building
looking for Joe Flood

1022
01:15:07,485 --> 01:15:08,887
ain't getting out.

1023
01:15:08,888 --> 01:15:11,555
Yeah, that makes sense, bruv.
So how do we get in?

1024
01:15:11,556 --> 01:15:13,558
You stay here in the rear.

1025
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:15,491
Don't let her
get away from you.

1026
01:15:15,492 --> 01:15:17,765
Who? Oh, her?

1027
01:15:19,137 --> 01:15:21,904
Yeah, bruv. No drama, man.

1028
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:15,823
No mas Botas.

1029
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:27,562
- Maize?
- Sorry, wish it were.

1030
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,641
- Lovedahl.
- Yeah, man.

1031
01:16:32,274 --> 01:16:33,508
Where's Maize?

1032
01:16:33,509 --> 01:16:35,774
I thought I'd bring her along
for the ride.

1033
01:16:35,775 --> 01:16:38,040
It's nice to leave the city
this time of year.

1034
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:41,243
- If you hurt her...
- I don't want to.

1035
01:16:41,244 --> 01:16:45,433
All I want to do is collect,
but you have my word.

1036
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,624
You get through all that,
present your big ass to me,

1037
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,225
and I will let
your little ballerina here go.

1038
01:16:52,226 --> 01:16:53,428
You feel me?

1039
01:16:53,429 --> 01:16:56,396
- Me for her?
- That's the real real.

1040
01:16:56,397 --> 01:16:57,697
Can I get a little help?

1041
01:16:57,698 --> 01:17:00,030
Come on, brother.
That would be unethical.

1042
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,405
- And kidnapping my woman?
- I'm morally flexible.

1043
01:17:03,406 --> 01:17:05,301
Is that another term
for asshole?

1044
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:09,239
Looks like you got
some more guests arriving.

an entrance down this way.

1049
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:35,098
Take your men down there
and secure the catacombs.

1050
01:17:35,099 --> 01:17:37,033
We'll go in through the front
and flush him out.

1051
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:39,404
- Yes, sir.
- You three, come with me.

1052
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,677
Yes, sir.

1053
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:15,272

1058

Just let me
walk around a minute?

1059
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,918
And do you know what?

1060
01:18:28,919 --> 01:18:30,804
You really
embarrassed me before.

1061
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:32,690
I'm trying
to get into the game,

1062
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,375
and my first job, wham!

1063
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,060
Thumped by a ballet dancer.

1064
01:18:36,061 --> 01:18:37,665
Come on, just let me
get the blood flow going!

1065
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:38,897
And do you know what?
No, no, no.

1066
01:18:38,898 --> 01:18:41,148
You caught me
by surprise before, yeah?

1067
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,399
This black nose
wouldn't have happened.

1068
01:18:44,407 --> 01:18:46,839
I'm sorry I hit you.

1069
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,311
All right, so if I let you
out the car now,

1070
01:18:49,312 --> 01:18:50,537
you're not gonna run?

1071
01:18:50,538 --> 01:18:52,142
You're not gonna go anywhere?
You're just gonna chill.

1072
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:54,711
Where am I gonna go?
No. I'm gonna chill.

1073
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:57,281
I just need to get
the blood flow going.

1074
01:18:59,455 --> 01:19:01,054
- Yeah?
- All right.

1075
01:19:01,055 --> 01:19:03,892
We're at a bit of a stall,
jump out the fucking car then.

1076
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:07,359
- Now come out the whip, man.
- One second.

1077
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,629
You were so eager
to get out of the car,

1078
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,424
now you don't want to move.

1079
01:19:11,425 --> 01:19:14,435
You want help?
Yeah, all right. Take my hand.

1080
01:19:14,436 --> 01:19:15,997
Dickhead.

1081
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:18,569
And stay there. Don't run off.

1082
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:07,718
Hard to kill.

1083
01:20:37,853 --> 01:20:39,355
Like Springsteen live,

1084
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:41,154
you do not disappoint.

1085
01:20:44,088 --> 01:20:45,690
You've seen The Boss live?

1086
01:20:45,691 --> 01:20:48,323
Meadowlands, 1997,

1087
01:20:48,324 --> 01:20:50,859
but his Broadway show
was truly special.

1088
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,599
Where's Maize?

1089
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,629
Me for her. That's the deal.

1090
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:57,566
Lose the shotgun.

1091
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,579
I'm gonna call my associate

1092
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,377
and have her
brought down here.

1093
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:09,886
You should've
told her the truth, Flood.

1094
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,282
What do you know about that?

1095
01:21:12,283 --> 01:21:15,254
What don't I know about
a woman's heart, brother?

1096
01:21:16,389 --> 01:21:18,361
I didn't think that was
the part of their anatomy

1097
01:21:18,362 --> 01:21:20,311
you'd be interested in.

1098
01:21:20,312 --> 01:21:22,261
You got me all wrong.

1099
01:21:32,904 --> 01:21:34,108
Get in the car!

1100
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,957
I got her.

1101
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,195
How the hell
the bitch get your car?

1102
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:02,798
She hit me with a branch.

1103
01:22:02,799 --> 01:22:03,935
A branch?

1104
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:05,502
How'd she get
a fucking branch?

1105
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:08,971
I... I let her out of the car
just for a minute, and then...

1106
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:13,042
- You dumbass fucking wannabe.
- Sorry, Mr. Lovedahl, sir.

1107
01:22:13,043 --> 01:22:15,316
Sorry, uh, really strong.

1108
01:22:15,317 --> 01:22:17,082
Um...

1109
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,617
I just want to say
that I don't really think

1110
01:22:18,618 --> 01:22:20,504
that I'm cut out
for this kind of work, sir.

1111
01:22:20,505 --> 01:22:22,391
That might be
the first intelligent thing

1112
01:22:22,392 --> 01:22:24,419
I've heard you say.

1113
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:27,563
- So, now what?
- The contract is still active.

1114
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:29,325
Oh, I'm not splitting my money

1115
01:22:29,326 --> 01:22:31,776
with you, Sly
and the Family Stone here.

1116
01:22:31,777 --> 01:22:34,228
We're mercenaries.
We already got paid.

1117
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:36,432
Now this is some bullshit.

1118
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:38,936
You tell Queen Bitch
if she still wants him dead,

1119
01:22:38,937 --> 01:22:40,309
the price is going up.

1120
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,439
Yeah, to what?

1121
01:22:42,339 --> 01:22:44,706
- Six million.
- Six million?

1122
01:22:45,978 --> 01:22:47,214
I gotta make a call.

1123
01:22:56,453 --> 01:22:57,690
Do you think I killed him?

1124
01:22:57,691 --> 01:22:59,393
I hope so.

1125
01:22:59,394 --> 01:23:01,096
What? No. Joe.

1126
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:02,928
No, I don't think you did.

1127
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:04,462
But I don't think
it felt great.

1128
01:23:05,129 --> 01:23:07,065
Good.

1129
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,200
The night we met,
the men who died...

1130
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:11,504
- Yeah, that was me.
- That was opening night!

1131
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:12,939
I'm sorry.

1132
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,457
And how about
the last 24 hours, Joe?

1133
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,332
Do you have
an explanation for that?

1134
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,305
- Or some bullshit apologies?
- No.

1135
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:20,277
- I thought I was dying.
- What?

1136
01:23:20,278 --> 01:23:22,245
I hired an old enemy
to take me out clean.

1137
01:23:22,246 --> 01:23:24,017
It turns out
I was misdiagnosed.

1138
01:23:24,018 --> 01:23:25,883
- What?
- I tried to protect you.

1139
01:23:25,884 --> 01:23:27,214
Protect me from who?

1140
01:23:27,215 --> 01:23:28,821
A bunch of killers or you?

1141
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:30,658
Both! From all of it.

1142
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:31,823
What do you do for a living?

1143
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:34,060
Huh?

1144
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:36,995
- Maize, I'm a hitman.
- You kill people?

1145
01:23:36,996 --> 01:23:38,261
Well, I'm retired from that.

1146
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:41,065
- You look it.
- I'm retiring.

1147
01:23:41,066 --> 01:23:42,563
You're a murderer for hire!

1148
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,701
That's what
an assassin is, yeah.

1149
01:23:44,702 --> 01:23:46,839
I don't know
if it'll make any difference

1150
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,007
but the people I work for,

1151
01:23:48,008 --> 01:23:50,640
we don't kill civilians,
just criminals.

1152
01:23:52,378 --> 01:23:54,550
Well, that's what
you've been doing.

1153
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,217
- You're retired.
- Yes.

1154
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,649
Good, because I'm not
having a kid with a killer.

1155
01:24:00,423 --> 01:24:01,555
A kid?

1156
01:24:01,556 --> 01:24:02,784
I'm pregnant, Joe.

1157
01:24:03,927 --> 01:24:05,154
I tried to tell you
the other night

1158
01:24:05,155 --> 01:24:06,722
but you broke up with me.

1159
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:11,460
Look, I love you, you love me,

1160
01:24:11,461 --> 01:24:13,828
and the rest we'll figure out
as we go, okay?

1161
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:17,205
I swear,
I'll never lie to you again.

1162
01:24:18,003 --> 01:24:19,137
Are you okay?

1163
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,738
- You better fucking not...
- Hey. Maize?

1164
01:24:21,609 --> 01:24:22,610
Jeez.

1165
01:24:40,796 --> 01:24:43,099
Shit. You caught one.

1166
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:11,826
Maize. Maize.

1167
01:25:11,827 --> 01:25:13,860
Come on, breathe.
Stay with me.

1168
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,167
Maize.

1169
01:25:35,419 --> 01:25:36,209
Maize.

1170
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:42,318
Perhaps I can be
of some assistance?

1171
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:43,902
Not unless you're a doctor.

1172
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:45,344
Do I look like a doctor?

1173
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:46,786
Is there one in the village?

1174
01:25:46,787 --> 01:25:48,359
There's a half decent vet.
The nearest doctor

1175
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,293
- is 40 kilometers away.
- Maize.

1176
01:25:51,294 --> 01:25:52,832
Hey, baby. Are you okay?

1177
01:25:55,934 --> 01:25:56,967
Joe.

1178
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:58,471
Baby.

1179
01:25:59,102 --> 01:26:00,341
Easy.

1180
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,544
You got shot.

1181
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:09,210
It hurts.

1182
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:11,281
It just grazed you.

1183
01:26:11,282 --> 01:26:13,384
I thought
I was gonna lose you.

1184
01:26:13,385 --> 01:26:15,653
You're gonna have to try
harder than that.

1185
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,459
Maize, I love you.

1186
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,791
Will you marry me?

1187
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,160
- What?
- Marry me.

1188
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:26,466
Be my wife.

1189
01:26:27,804 --> 01:26:28,662
To have and to hold,

1190
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:30,404
sickness and health,
the whole thing.

1191
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:32,872
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1192
01:26:32,873 --> 01:26:33,935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1193
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,413
Father, will you marry us?

1194
01:26:44,414 --> 01:26:46,146
Do you have
a marriage license?

1195
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:47,681
No.

1196
01:26:47,682 --> 01:26:50,358
- Do you have any witnesses?
- You.

1197
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:52,690
Are you even Catholic?

1198
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:55,292
I think my mother was.

1199
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,492
Oh. So it's guilt
by association.

1200
01:26:57,493 --> 01:26:59,531
Look, Father, in the last day

1201
01:26:59,532 --> 01:27:02,137
I've had more people try
to kill me than I can count,

1202
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:04,186
and I just found out
I'm gonna be a father.

1203
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:06,235
So I might not get
another shot at this,

1204
01:27:06,236 --> 01:27:07,740
so what do you say?

1205
01:27:07,741 --> 01:27:09,245
On one condition.

1206
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:11,476
Yeah, name it.

1207
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,041
You must give confession.

1208
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:14,316
Ooh.

1209
01:27:15,352 --> 01:27:18,320
I don't think we have
that kind of time, Father.

1210
01:27:19,788 --> 01:27:21,022
Make time.

1211
01:27:21,023 --> 01:27:22,258
Oh, man.

1212
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,891
So that brings us up
to the last couple months.

1213
01:27:25,892 --> 01:27:27,756
Um...

1214
01:27:27,757 --> 01:27:30,196
There was a chief
of a Corsican crime syndicate.

1215
01:27:30,197 --> 01:27:32,460
That was one shot
over a mile out.

1216
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:33,893
A Romanian arms dealer.

1217
01:27:33,894 --> 01:27:37,170
Uh, did him
at close range with a pistol.

1218
01:27:37,171 --> 01:27:39,742
A rogue British agent
in Geneva.

1219
01:27:39,743 --> 01:27:41,505
That was hand-to-hand...

1220
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:45,241
A Russian oligarch in Vienna,
a garrote.

1221
01:27:45,242 --> 01:27:46,577
I mean, real quiet.

1222
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:49,678
In all my years as a priest,
as a human being,

1223
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:52,715
I have never heard
anything remotely...

1224
01:27:52,716 --> 01:27:55,551
And last night, there was
the entire Goyang crew.

1225
01:27:55,552 --> 01:27:58,388
They came after me,
so technically, self-defense.

1226
01:27:58,389 --> 01:28:02,357
Murder is murder is murder.

1227
01:28:02,358 --> 01:28:03,559
No technicalities.

1228
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,263
Most of my targets
never saw it coming.

1229
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:08,967
Kind of a point of pride
with top hitmen.

1230
01:28:08,968 --> 01:28:10,266
Pride is a sin.

1231
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:11,435
Well, kind of lightweight

1232
01:28:11,436 --> 01:28:12,801
compared to contract killing, right?

1233
01:28:12,802 --> 01:28:15,688
I'm not sure I'm qualified
to pardon all of this.

1234
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:18,575
What, do you need to call
the Vatican or something?

1235
01:28:18,576 --> 01:28:20,648
They'd tell me
to call the police.

1236
01:28:21,815 --> 01:28:22,976
Look, Father.

1237
01:28:22,977 --> 01:28:26,355
The way I see it is your boss,
the man upstairs,

1238
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,253
he's given me a second chance.

1239
01:28:29,254 --> 01:28:31,090
I'm gonna be a father,

1240
01:28:31,091 --> 01:28:32,861
so I don't want
to mess that up.

1241
01:28:32,862 --> 01:28:34,128
I'll give you redemption,

1242
01:28:34,129 --> 01:28:36,090
but no more killing,
no more murder.

1243
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:38,463
Well, there might be some
self-defense in the near future.

1244
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:41,035
Do you get this?
It's a sin. It's wrong.

1245
01:28:41,036 --> 01:28:42,602
You asked for a confession.

1246
01:28:42,603 --> 01:28:44,766
I wish I kept my mouth shut
if we're both being honest here.

1247
01:28:44,767 --> 01:28:47,508
So are you gonna marry us now,
or what?

1248
01:28:49,772 --> 01:28:51,807
Ego te absolvo. I absolve you.

1249
01:28:51,808 --> 01:28:53,842
All right. Thank you, Father.

1250
01:28:53,843 --> 01:28:56,313
Dearly beloved,
you're gathered here today

1251
01:28:56,314 --> 01:28:57,745
in the presence of God

1252
01:28:57,746 --> 01:29:00,186
to declare
your love, honor, fidelity,

1253
01:29:00,187 --> 01:29:01,683
and commitment to one another

1254
01:29:01,684 --> 01:29:03,718
for as long
as you both shall live.

1255
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:05,922
I don't suppose
you have a ring, do you?

1256
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,991
Um... Oh!

1257
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:11,895
Will this do?

1258
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:16,897
As long as the grenade
is far away.

1259
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:20,073
It went off hours ago.
One of the party girls.

1260
01:29:20,074 --> 01:29:21,439
I lost track. Silly me.

1261
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,604
Back to the wedding.

1262
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:25,881
Do you, Joe, take this woman

1263
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:28,175
to love, honor and obey

1264
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:31,015
in sickness and in health
for as long as you shall live?

1265
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:32,081
I do.

1266
01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:38,289
And do you, Maize,
take this man

1267
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,754
to love, honor, and obey?

1268
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:42,293
- I don't know about obey.
- Maize!

1269
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,298
I object!

1270
01:29:45,299 --> 01:29:46,933
You couldn't have waited
30 seconds?

1271
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:48,569
You done made this shit
hard enough!

1272
01:29:49,673 --> 01:29:50,673
Shit!

1273
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,343
I got this!

1274
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,579
I don't think so!

1275
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,417
The boss said,
"Fuck your six million!"

1276
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:07,181
The game's changed,
my brother!

1277
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,889
Okay. Easy. All right.

1278
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:13,686
Okay.

1279
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:16,229
You're okay. You're okay.

1280
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:17,862
All right.
Keep pressure on that.

1281
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,834
- Wait, Joe.
- I gotta finish this.

1282
01:30:26,503 --> 01:30:27,806
Flood!

1283
01:30:28,473 --> 01:30:29,874
You know how this goes.

1284
01:30:30,442 --> 01:30:31,979
It's not personal.

1285
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,509
It's strictly business.

1286
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:35,612
I don't know about you, Flood,

1287
01:30:35,613 --> 01:30:37,783
but I'm taking this
mighty personally.

1288
01:30:43,227 --> 01:30:45,461
I ain't dead yet,
motherfucker!

1289
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,368
I've seen fights at weddings.

1290
01:30:54,369 --> 01:30:56,302
This is not like that.
Who are you people?

1291
01:30:56,303 --> 01:30:58,138
- I got shot.
- I know.

1292
01:30:58,139 --> 01:30:59,739
After giving confession.

1293
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:17,451
Like horseshoes
and hand grenades, baby!

1294
01:31:17,452 --> 01:31:18,786
Come on!

1295
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:21,159
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

1296
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,294
That's enough.

1297
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:24,029
They're breaking my church.

1298
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,501
Flood!

1299
01:31:26,531 --> 01:31:28,169
Just come on out, baby!

1300
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,901
I'll kill you quick,
I promise.

1301
01:31:50,994 --> 01:31:51,994
Fuck!

1302
01:31:59,296 --> 01:32:00,497
Fuck!

1303
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:04,702
Tell me, Flood.

1304
01:32:04,703 --> 01:32:06,942
You really think there's
a happily ever after

1305
01:32:06,943 --> 01:32:08,101
for guys like us?

1306
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:10,342
You think you're just
gonna walk out of here,

1307
01:32:10,343 --> 01:32:12,512
go home and play house?

1308
01:32:12,513 --> 01:32:14,565
The boss is never
going to stop, Flood.

1309
01:32:14,566 --> 01:32:16,618
You'll have
to kill that bitch, too.

1310
01:32:19,882 --> 01:32:21,755
Help, help me, boss...

1311
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:25,759
He wasn't gonna make it.

1312
01:32:27,328 --> 01:32:28,924
I'm a professional.

1313
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:31,895
You guys come
right out of a comic book.

1314
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:48,617
Unlucky.

1315
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:52,047
You know, there are only
two ways out of the game.

1316
01:32:52,048 --> 01:32:54,585
You walk away clean,
or you go out on your...

1317
01:32:59,757 --> 01:33:01,663
Or you go out on your back.

1318
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:05,867
Hey. It's okay.

1319
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:10,437
- Are you okay?
- He... He was going to...

1320
01:33:10,438 --> 01:33:12,068
I know. It's okay.
You did good.

1321
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:15,641
- Should we finish him?
- No. I'm retired.

1322
01:33:15,642 --> 01:33:16,856
Y'all make a cute couple,

1323
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,836
but don't leave
a brother hanging.

1324
01:33:18,837 --> 01:33:20,816
Come on, Flood!
Get me out of here!

1325
01:33:20,817 --> 01:33:21,881
Really?

1326
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:23,912
Come on, man!

1327
01:33:23,913 --> 01:33:26,187
Maybe you should
retire too.

1328
01:33:26,188 --> 01:33:27,788
Y'all don't leave me here!

1329
01:33:34,228 --> 01:33:35,290
Fuck this.

1330
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,931
You know better
than to run.

1331
01:33:46,443 --> 01:33:48,709
Your boy
hasn't left me any choice.

1332
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:52,010
There's only two ways
out of the game, Antoinette.

1333
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:54,982
Who put the contract on me?

1334
01:33:54,983 --> 01:33:56,011
You did.

1335
01:33:56,012 --> 01:33:58,881
You hired mercenaries
on a contract job.

1336
01:33:58,882 --> 01:34:01,751
Just like your father,
you broke the rules.

1337
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:05,424
Fuck you, and fuck the rules!

1338
01:34:05,425 --> 01:34:06,590
Don't hate the player...

1339
01:34:09,759 --> 01:34:11,326
hate the game.

are much appreciated, Joe.

1349
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:42,463
Well, I did play a hand

1350
01:34:42,464 --> 01:34:43,861
in wrecking it
in the first place.

1351
01:34:43,862 --> 01:34:46,530
Acceptance is the beginning
of deliverance.

1352
01:34:46,531 --> 01:34:49,199
- How's your shoulder?
- It fucking hurts.

1353
01:34:52,169 --> 01:34:54,089
What kind of ring
do you call that?

1354
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:56,010
Yeah,
what kind of ring is that?

1355
01:34:56,011 --> 01:34:57,005
Tactical?

1356
01:34:57,006 --> 01:34:58,790
- Tactical, yeah. Tactique.
- Tactical.

1357
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,576
- Mm.
- En francais.

1358
01:35:00,577 --> 01:35:02,629
Merci.

1359
01:35:04,683 --> 01:35:06,587
You know,
if you're ever short,

1360
01:35:06,588 --> 01:35:08,586
with Antoinette gone
and every decent hitter

1361
01:35:08,587 --> 01:35:09,921
in Europe out of the game,

1362
01:35:09,922 --> 01:35:11,987
I'm going to have more work
than I can manage.

1363
01:35:11,988 --> 01:35:13,725
- I'm retired.
- No, he's retired.

1364
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:15,558
I just wanted
to hear him say it.

1365
01:35:15,559 --> 01:35:17,392
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1366
01:35:18,696 --> 01:35:20,095
Look after him.

1367
01:35:20,096 --> 01:35:21,495
So handsome.

1368
01:35:23,073 --> 01:35:24,073
Thank you.

1369
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:26,903
He's retired.

1370
01:35:28,171 --> 01:35:29,408
You know we're
gonna have to start saving

1371
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:30,825
for a college fund.

1372
01:35:30,826 --> 01:35:32,242
Yeah, that's true.

1373
01:35:32,243 --> 01:35:34,910
I mean, how much would you get
to just, like, hurt somebody?

1374
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:36,781
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1375
01:35:36,782 --> 01:35:38,651
Um, well, college isn't cheap,

1376
01:35:38,652 --> 01:35:40,751
but first there's daycare,
of course.

1377
01:35:40,752 --> 01:35:42,248
Diapers are crazy expensive.

1378
01:35:42,249 --> 01:35:44,284
Baby formula
is even more expensive.

1379
01:35:44,285 --> 01:35:46,253
Oh, and we're gonna need
one of those baskets.
