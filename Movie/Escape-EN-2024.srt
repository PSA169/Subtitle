FINAL MOMENT OF DESERTERS

ESCAPE

11
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,827
Compatriots of North Korea,
this is the Sound of Freedom.

12
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:12,540
This bell represents
freedom, peace and hope.

13
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,865
Did we come too far?

14
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,902
We might come across Southern soldiers.

15
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,974
We could just wave at them,
what's the big deal?

16
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:29,429
Birds are flying low,
it might rain soon.

17
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,869
It'll pour in 2 days.

18
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,859
Rain? It's gonna rain?

19
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:56,007
Not according to the forecast.

20
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:59,050
Yes, I heard there will
be a shower in 4 days.

21
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,207
2 days earlier than the forecast?

22
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,374
Foot soldier Kim Dong-hyuk
is better than high tech--

23
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,113
How will we go on without you?

24
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:53,519
Can't you stay here and not discharge?

25
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,457
Are you so desperate
to get your ribs smashed?

26
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,582
I endured 10 long years...

27
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,290
...I won't even look back
when I walk out of here.

28
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,208
What'll you do outside?

29
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:06,957
I got... no plans.

30
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,707
But I'll live to the fullest.

31
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,372
Will you go to college?

32
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,888
Nonsense!

33
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,715
He's from a bottom
dwelling third-rate family.

34
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,124
He's bound for farms or coal mines.

35
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,121
So bleak, his future is bleak.

36
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,081
Look at these bitches
crawling up my ass.

37
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,582
If you don't wish to be
cut up like this boar...

38
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,044
...use your damn tongues
to taste this meat.

39
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:50,538
We received a report that boars
were loitering in the minefield.

40
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,695
Shut your trap.

41
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,798
As you know, over 15 men have
been evacuated for malnutrition.

42
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,213
Why are you telling me that?

43
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,650
We couldn't free the boar
we found during canvasing.

44
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,754
Boar?

45
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:11,756
That's right, sir.

46
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:15,301
I thought it could replenish
our men's health--

47
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,927
That's why you crossed
the demarcation line?

48
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:21,273
How will you lead the revolution
with that mindset?!

49
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:25,182
I'll put this lunatic in front
of the executive summary.

50
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:29,369
This is Supreme Leader's manual.

51
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,120
Look at this.

52
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:36,382
He instructed us to eat
as much meat as possible.

53
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,406
That's exactly what
Sgt. Lim here is doing.

54
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,860
Then I'll go ahead and feed my men.

55
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:48,737
But there's an order to things.

56
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,272
Cheers!

57
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,181
Thank you.

58
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:57,467
Our Supreme Leader announced,
"Deserters do not exist in my book"...

59
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:03,610
...and ordered the troops to be vigilant
with monitoring each other--

60
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:09,607
3668 says, "We'll have fried chicken
for my bro's birthday tonight...

61
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:14,024
...but I'm fighting with my dad
whether to order fried or seasoned.

62
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:15,912
Isn't seasoned chicken the norm?"

63
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,983
Enjoy both types with your family.

64
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,707
We'll send you a coupon.

65
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,015
Let's hear the next story.

66
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,487
"Hello, I live in Seoul
and I'm 28 years old.

67
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:32,183
People say I'm too old to
take on a new challenge...

68
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:36,040
...but I will take on my dream head on.

69
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:39,983
In a world that sets my boundaries...

70
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,307
...I thought, 'No point in struggling.'

71
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,418
'Why is my life so messed up?'

72
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,397
I always blamed myself.

73
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:49,924
Then I came to a realization.

74
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,987
If I don't take action,
nothing will get accomplished.

75
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:57,015
I have to seek my own happiness.

76
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:59,318
That's why I want
to take up this challenge.

77
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,983
Please cheer me on as I start again.

78
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,433

I'll forget about today.

00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,591
You wanted this, right?

121
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,346
I don't need it since I'm discharging.

122
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:18,744
Take it.

123
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,579
Thank you.

124
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:43,101
- Rise!
- Rise!

125
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,900
- Deserter on the loose!
- Deserter on the loose!

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,407
We got a deserter! Come on out!

127
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,871
Hurry up!

128
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,341
Move to the barbed-wire fence!

129
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,674
- To the barbed-wire fence!
- This way! Go!

130
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,457
Get moving!

131
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,712
Go!

132
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,874
Run! Hurry up!

133
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:17,881
Kim Dong-hyuk!

134
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,331
Where is the hole?
Where did you dig it?

135
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,438
- Let's head back.
- I'll get shot if I do!

136
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,356
No, I diverted the platoon,
let's head back.

137
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,497
You were going to go anyway.

138
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,165
I'm gonna go alone.

139
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,658
I just need to dig this!

140
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,942
Dong-hyuk!

141
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,691
Lead the way!

142
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,426
Lower the gun,
this is not the time to go.

143
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:52,400
Rain will start before dawn,
we'll lose our window!

144
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,417
I know, so let's defect while
canvasing the DMZ, okay?

145
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:59,792
I don't know this route,
so we're as good as dead.

146
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:03,335
Let's use my route later tonight.

147
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,328
Where's the map?

148
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,920
Platoon leader, it's no big deal.

149
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,769
Comrade Kim has an illness,
he sleepwalks.

150
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,594
He unknowingly got out--

151
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,304
Deserter, does this hurt?

152
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,554
It's not over.

153
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,128
You drew this.

154
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,603
Am I right?

155
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:09,445
Dong-hyuk, then is this yours?

156
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,550
If you keep your mouth shut,
you'll take the fall.

157
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,615
Don't you know what that means?

158
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:19,524
Firing squad.

159
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,239
What happened was...

160
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,999
It's mine!

161
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,215
Comrade Lim didn't do anything wrong!

162
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,715
You're so full of shit.

163
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,504

Lim Kyu-nam and Kim Dong-hyuk...

171
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,707
...committed a serious offense
of deserting in tandem.

172
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,040
Judging by this map, they've been
planning for a long time...

173
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,332
...and both must be executed
to uphold discipline in the Party!

174
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,197
Yes, of course.

00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:24,914
...according to this report,
Kim confessed to making the map.

178
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,946
Then why is Sgt. Lim getting punished?

179
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:35,614
They were very close for a long time...

180
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,744
Very close?

181
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,578
Very close...

182
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,311
- Lt. Park Joon-pyong.
- Yes, sir!

183
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,511
- Lt. Park Joon-pyong.
- Yes, sir!

184
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,203
Tell me.

185
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:08,962
Is there any evidence that
Sgt. Lim made the map?

186
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,249
Very triumphant.

187
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,678
A desertion was attempted by your men,
and yet you all look triumphant.

188
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,426
I'll explain this one more time.

189
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:31,100
When Kim attempted desertion,
Sgt. Lim tried to apprehend him...

190
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,928
...even though he cared about him.

191
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:37,040
Did you not say Lim was in control
of Kim when they were caught?

192
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,141
That's right, sir!

193
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,724
- Is that true?
- That's right, sir!

194
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:40,941
That's the truth.

195
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,657
What's more important than facts
during a judgment?

196
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,874
To analyze this incident with truth...

197
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,691
REWARD AND PUNISHMENT COMMITTEE

198
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:58,957
Supreme Leader is unhappy with
deserters popping up in our republic.

199
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:05,040
And do you think it's a good idea
to report about 2 deserters?

200
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:08,837
Or say that we have a hero
within our ranks...

201
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,248
...who caught the deserter?

202
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:03,529
Hey, Kyu-nam.

203
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,884
It's been a while.

204
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,691
Kyu-nam, were you trying to desert?

205
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:16,934
Not at all.

206
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:20,162
I was only trying to
catch the deserter.

207
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:23,219
Right? You don't have
the conviction to desert.

208
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,100
Like father, like son.

209
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:31,857
Come on, focus on the road.

210
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,733
When your father drove for us,
he was always so calm.

211
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,795
Remember my dog, Thunder?

212
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,992
He loved sleeping when he drove.

213
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,239
Is your mother well?

214
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:57,285
- She must be happy about your discharge.
- She passed away last year.

215
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:58,801
Oh my...

216
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:02,112
I think I heard that news.

217
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,152
No one to return home to.
It must trouble you quite a bit.

218
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:09,965
- What will you do afterwards?
- I have no troubles.

219
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:13,439
I will perform my duties to
wherever the Party assigns me to.

220
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,835
Bastard, that's why I like you.

221
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:18,978
You know how to accept your fate.

222
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:31,442
Comrade Field Officer!

223
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,918
I'm older and I outrank you,
but call me 'bro' like before.

224
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:46,954
Bro, where are we going?

225
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:18,367
You should tell me where...

226
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:23,945
Director General is having a banquet
at the division HQ today...

227
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:26,596
...and Division Commander...

228
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:30,225
...or my father-in-law,
needs something to boast about...

229
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,619
...so you'll have to be in top form.

230
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,157
What do I do...

231
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,201
Kyu-nam.

232
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:45,474
You're a hero who caught
a deserter, no?

233
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,057
Right.

234
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:59,082
HYUNPOONG-RI

235
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,318
Here is today's forecast.

236
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,039
Pyongyang enjoyed seasonal
weather of 11 degrees today.

237
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,831
It's cloudy throughout, and the forecast
has changed to heavy shower around 7PM.

238
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,393
FOR FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS OF PEOPLE

239
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,678
This is my son-in-law!

240
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,302
You must be comrade Li Taek-gi's son.

241
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,542
My father told me
so much about you, sir.

242
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,150
Did you not come with your wife?

243
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:24,631
She's pregnant, so, she's at home.

244
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,025
Congratulations.

245
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,165
Thank you.

246
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:33,124
It's been a while,
but you came so far for us.

247
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,040
Thank you!

248
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:54,112
My dearest comrades of Division 1...

249
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:56,875
...and our distinguished guests.

250
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:00,205
Please accept my deepest appreciation...

251
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:06,388
...for your valiant trust
for our Supreme Leader...

252
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:09,513
...and our great Party...

253
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:15,691
...and for the advancement
of the republic...

254
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:19,511
...and happiness of our people...

255
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:23,290
...we must push forward
so that we do not lag behind...

256
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,507
We must call upon a hero...

257
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,699
...who fulfilled his task to
the best of his abilities!

258
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,509
Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam!

259
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,923
What was it like to catch
a reactionary deserter?

260
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:21,101
This was only possible
due to the foresightedness...

261
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,418
...of the guidance by Division Commander.

262
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,184
I'd like to dedicate this honor to him!

263
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,610
Why are you walking around
like a mutt holding piss?

264
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,940
It's getting late,
I must return to my base...

265
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,797
You don't have to.

266
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,715
Pardon?

267
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:31,954
You're now assigned to the division HQ.

268
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:34,128
Aide to the commander.

269
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:40,203
I'm looking out for you,
so let's get you set up.

270
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,844
Come on, let's move!

271
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:55,972
Field Officer!

272
00:28:56,684 --> 00:29:00,349
Are you courteous or just trolling?

273
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:02,594
I told you to call me 'bro'!

274
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:08,021
I'm about to discharge,
why am I reassigned here?

275
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:11,170
Stay in the military,
you got nothing better outside.

276
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,405
Being an aide is nothing special.

277
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,941
Do some chores and drive him around.

278
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,330
But how could you decide
my future on your own?

279
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:26,016
Then do you decide your future?

280
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:36,541
Kyu-nam.

281
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:43,614
Not everyone gets a chance
like this, don't you know?

282
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:49,380
Look over there, he's here for you.

283
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,029
Go on.

284
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,836
Well noted.

285
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:02,082
But let me go back to my base first.

286
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,586
This is all too sudden.

287
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,737
I need to say good bye to my men
and retrieve my things.

288
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:13,899
What did you leave behind?

289
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:37,996
Wasn't this your father's?

290
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,124
Keep it safe.

291
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,730
Don't be distracted and accept it.

292
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:57,524
This is your fate.

293
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,132
Comrade Lim Kyu-nam...

294
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,202
...let's go.

295
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:25,728
Can I get a photo of me?

296
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,028
TRANSFER FORM

297
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,042
ONE MUST RELY ON HIMSELF

298
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,978
MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE PASS

299
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,053
You must be so busy with work
but you're so family-oriented.

300
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:18,815
Charity and loyalty to country
begin at home.

301
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,972
Did you stop playing piano?

302
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,122
Haven't heard the rumor?

303
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:46,082
I heard his piano skills are topnotch.

304
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,965
I knew your fingers looked special.

305
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,065
Please play for us,
I'd love to hear it.

306
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,976
I forgot everything.

307
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,810
Please show us.

308
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,657
I really did forget everything.

309
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,487
But even so...

310
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,259
- Everything okay?
- Pardon?

311
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,173
I came for an inspection.

312
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,425
No activities at the guard post, sir!

313
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:38,636
Shouldn't you be in on full alert?

314
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:42,413
Give me your binoculars.

315
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,873
Water, water!

316
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:07,527
HYUNPOONG-RI

317
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:25,012
Good day, may I borrow some gasoline?

318
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,646
Got a pass?

319
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:32,658
Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam,
aide to Division 1 commander.

320
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,610
How does his aide go
anywhere without filling up?

321
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,700
Driving a vehicle alone, no less.

322
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,704
Get me the division commander office.

323
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,698
I'm on a classified mission.

324
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:09,835
Does the commander have an aide...

325
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,837
SGT. LIM KYU-NAM
- ...named Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam?

326
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:24,292
Carrying out a classified mission
on the day of transfer?

327
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,068
I got dispatched there
for this mission.

328
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,701
Dispatched? Oh dear.

329
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,813
Are you with the State Security
or something?

330
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:41,811
You said you needed gasoline.

331
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:43,652
Come with us.

332
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,572
I cannot delay my mission any further.

333
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:49,907
We don't have any spare gas anyway.

334
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,712
Come with us over that hill
to the Hyunpoong-ri station.

335
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:58,727
Isn't the deserter from earlier
today locked up there?

336
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:01,340
His name is Kim Dong-hyuk.

337
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,189
How did you know that?

338
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,447
I told you I received an order.

339
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,149
Are you really from the State Security?

340
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,718
I cannot go into details...

341
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:20,538
...but there's an intel
about his co-conspirator...

342
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:24,720
...and to track him down,
I need all evidence...

343
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,686
...and his map.

344
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:38,427
HYUNPOONG-RI DEMILITARIZED ZONE POLICE

345
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:05,037
This is Kim Dong-hyuk's evidence.

346
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,580
TRANSFER FORM

347
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,768
LIM KYU-NAM

348
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,521
I can't die... I can't die...

349
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,657
I can't die... I can't die...

350
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:38,443
Hey, Kim Dong-hyuk.

351
00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:39,833
Forgive me...

352
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,025
I'm sorry...

353
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,193
I'm sorry...

354
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:53,727
Why are you sorry
for missing your mother?

355
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:02,647
I told you we'll leave
together tonight.

356
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,089
Let's go.

357
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:30,853
All done? No trouble
carrying out your mission?

358
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,118
All seems to be in order here at
Hyunpoong-ri under your supervision.

359
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:39,953
I'll make sure to include it
in my report.

360
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,065
- No need.
- Sir.

361
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:50,772
Are you my girlfriend?

362
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:53,590
How dare you whisper in front of him!

363
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:56,349
Comrade Lim requested gasoline...

364
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:58,401
...but this vehicle requires diesel!

365
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,175
It's suspicious that he doesn't know
what his operation vehicle takes!

366
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,073
Are you suspecting our
State Security comrade?

367
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,369
He was dispatched today,
that could happen.

368
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,515
Please do not take any offense.

369
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,377
Not at all.

370
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,761
I learned something
about your alertness.

371
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:50,951
Very good, complete alertness.

372
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:54,267
We always strive for it,
but it never reaches a desired level...

373
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:57,975
...and we'll cooperate with you
to the best of my abilities...

374
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:01,177
...since you took kindly to us.

375
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,962
Thank you.

376
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:05,090
Hey!

377
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,233
Get him going with a vehicle
and one of our men.

378
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:12,206
Just the vehicle would be fine.

379
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:14,410
My mission could be delayed
if I move in a group...

380
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:15,643
Not at all.

381
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:19,939
There may be backlash
if we don't support you fully.

382
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,336
Just as precaution, I'll back you up.

383
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:37,250
He's Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam.

384
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Who is it?

385
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,269
A State Security agent I know.

386
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,332
I asked him about you,
he doesn't know you.

387
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,553
My affiliation and mission are
classified, don't you know?

388
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,669
It'd be great if you could verify
who your direct superior is.

389
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:57,997
Why? Can't remember
your superior's name?

390
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:06,016
Put me through Li Hyun-sang.
Is he still at the banquet?

391
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:11,305
He sent me on a mission
while he has fun at the banquet.

392
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:15,397
By the way, why are you in bed
with a DMZ Police?

393
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,570
Watch your mouth before I shove
your head up your ass!

394
00:45:25,004 --> 00:45:27,390
Comrade Li, there may be a problem.

395
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,533
- Lt. Hong Su--
- Shut your mouth and answer my questions.

396
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,421
Yes, our current location--

397
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:40,374
Comrade Li,
the mission is going well.

398
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:44,231
Kyu-nam, what will you do?

399
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,290
What's wrong with doing
what I want to do?

400
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:56,570
Come back, I'll make sure
your punishment is minimal.

401
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,121
No. I've decided my own future.

402
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:22,593
TAKE HIM BACK TO THE DIVISION.

403
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,378
- Take a right.
- Isn't it left?

404
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,721
Right.

405
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:38,612
Step on it!

406
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,915
FOR THE FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS OF PEOPLE

407
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:47,072
So loud...

408
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:29,197
That son of a bitch...

409
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:39,451
Dong-hyuk! Run!

410
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:20,176
Tell me.

411
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:24,056
How much of Lim's desertion
have you reported?

412
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:26,819
It was too crazy to report in...

413
00:50:27,314 --> 00:50:28,659
My apologies, sir!

414
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:32,622
No need to apologize, you did good.

415
00:50:37,841 --> 00:50:39,354
Commander, it hasn't been reported...

416
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:41,528
Hey, you! Hey! Hey!

417
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,624
Are you out of your damn mind?

418
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:49,354
If you send me a company,
I'll wrap this up cleanly.

419
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:54,426
Yes, I'll make sure to never
inconvenience you again.

420
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:01,953
I'm gonna fuck him up...

421
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:31,692
You okay?

422
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:17,968
Which unit sent you?

423
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:28,448
Nomads, right?
We're being chased too.

424
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,418
We're on the same boat.

425
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:33,195
Get rid of them.

426
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:35,021
Please don't kill us!

427
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:38,855
I barely got out of the holding cell
in Hyunpoong-ri!

428
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:41,243
Please don't kill us!

429
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,040
Sang-gu, Sang-gu...

430
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:48,824
Did you see Sang-gu?

431
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,337
What?

432
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:53,269
Did you see Sang-gu
in the holding cell?

433
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,047
Say you know, say you know...

434
00:52:59,235 --> 00:53:03,436
Don't try to bullshit us,
did you see him or not?

435
00:53:03,656 --> 00:53:05,438
I never heard of that name.

436
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,449
He's so clueless...

437
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,941
The bushy hair?

438
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:11,828
The bushy hair next door...

439
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:15,404
"I can't die... I can't die..."

440
00:53:16,347 --> 00:53:19,260
There was a boy who mumbled
while staring at the wall...

441
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:21,161
Did he say how he was caught?

442
00:53:22,604 --> 00:53:26,823
I don't know, but he said
he missed his sister terribly.

443
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:31,123
Sang-gu's alive.

444
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,314
That's a relief.

445
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,692
How did you end up on the run?

446
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,482
We're not on the run.

447
00:53:47,677 --> 00:53:50,738
We're seeking a way to live
after getting kicked out of our village.

448
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:53,435
But I'm more worried about Sang-gu.

449
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,104
Why don't you rescue him?

450
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:00,940
We can rescue him.

451
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:05,099
This is the Hyunpoong-ri station,
and the basement is the holding cell.

452
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,978
Security near the entrance
is too tight...

453
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,503
...so the only way in is...

454
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:16,355
...a window around back.

455
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:17,894
It must be locked.

456
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,913
No, guards open it
during cigarette breaks.

457
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:23,540
I saw it, I saw it with my eyes.

458
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,290
This guy is expert at peeping,
it must be true.

459
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:36,314
We rescue him tomorrow.

460
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:42,544
Miss...

461
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:47,453
...don't lose hope.

462
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,527
There's nothing here.

463
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:20,233
You make the judgment?

464
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:22,206
Push forward.

465
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:24,442
It's the pursuit unit.

466
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:01,982
Stop.

467
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:05,709
What's above you?

468
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,967
Desertion route found,
there's a hole in the ceiling.

469
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,965
The pursuit unit, take the right.

470
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,708
Split into left and right flanks.

471
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:41,647
Rear unit, deploy.

472
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,168
Cease fire.

473
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,865
Cease fire!

474
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:27,172
Search the valley.

475
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,638
Kyu-nam.

476
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:58,943
No one will get out of here alive.

477
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,044
Deserters spotted, 3 o'clock!

478
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,397
Are you deaf?!

479
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:41,309
2 deserters couldn't
fire all those bullets!

480
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:44,082
Get back to your position, get back!

481
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,664
THE BASTARD I LOVED

482
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,732
What do you want?

483
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:43,230
I enjoyed your performance.

484
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,605
Not as good as you used to be.

485
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,071
What happened to the winner
of international piano competitions?

486
01:00:50,243 --> 01:00:51,252
I'm hanging up...

487
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:52,633
...I'm working.

488
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:58,839
- What work?
- Chasing a mutt who fled home.

489
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:09,066
You can't forget it, can you?

490
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,626
Our days in Russia...

491
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:15,095
At the Saint Petersburg theatre...

492
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,476
Tired?

493
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:20,084
Not at all...

494
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,540
We're almost there, right?

495
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,999
You said that over a dozen times.

496
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:31,841
Fine, but why must we
head back to our base?

497
01:02:32,394 --> 01:02:35,184
If we take an unknown path,
mines will blow us up...

498
01:02:35,303 --> 01:02:38,725
...and reaching the mess hall
is as good as being in the South...

499
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,807
...that's what you said a dozen times.

500
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,900
Fine, fine, but...

501
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,929
Please stop asking me.
Talking is harder than walking.

502
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,335
- Dong-hyuk...
- Yes?

503
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:54,658
What do you want to eat
when you reach the South?

504
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:55,925
Meat...

505
01:02:56,504 --> 01:03:00,641
There are many kinds of meat,
do you want beef or pork?

506
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:02,139
Chicken...

507
01:03:05,233 --> 01:03:07,732
Many types of chicken too.

508
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,857
Chicken? Half fried?

509
01:03:09,983 --> 01:03:11,440
Seasoned half.

510
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,415
Chug it down with ice cold beer...

511
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,681
...damn, that must be heaven.

512
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,213
Ryu, I don't think you're fit
to be a soldier.

513
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:24,320
No, sir!

514
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,919
What was your dream before?

515
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,579
Go and fulfill that dream.

516
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:33,887
My apologies, sir!

517
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:48,934
Prove to me that your decision
is not wrong.

518
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:02,482
WARNING - THIS IS A MILITARY BASE,
TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT

519
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:05,576
MESS HALL

520
01:04:12,191 --> 01:04:14,967
If rain moves those mines,
my map is useless.

521
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:17,393
- We have to hurry.
- Okay.

522
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:50,927
Proud men of DMZ Police!

523
01:05:51,377 --> 01:05:54,582
I am State Security Field Officer
Li Hyun-sang!

524
01:05:55,186 --> 01:06:00,115
Due to my negligence,
two deserters are on the loose!

525
01:06:01,778 --> 01:06:02,878
However!

526
01:06:03,061 --> 01:06:07,601
They will never set their foot
outside this base...

527
01:06:08,288 --> 01:06:12,119
...and their lives will be cut short!

528
01:06:14,465 --> 01:06:19,582
For this to happen,
I need your full support...

529
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:23,583
...and whoever brings back their bodies...

530
01:06:24,388 --> 01:06:26,200
...will be given the title...

531
01:06:26,777 --> 01:06:27,984
...of a hero!

532
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:35,038
MESS HALL

533
01:06:41,137 --> 01:06:42,375
Lim Kyu-nam!

534
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:44,703
I'm gonna be a hero for once!

535
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:47,990
Open up, you traitor!

536
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:52,081
Smash it down!

537
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:01,860
Hurry up! Smash it!

538
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:34,999
I'll kill that backstabbing traitor!

539
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,880
Deserter on the loose!
Heading for the forward post!

540
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,690
Towards the ridge!

541
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,350
We are almost there,
they can't follow us now!

542
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,360
Dong-hyuk, what are you doing?!

543
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,350
Dong-hyuk!

544
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,320
Kyu-nam, give this necklace to her.

545
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,920
It's my mom's... birthday present...

546
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:53,040
If I can't give this to her,
I'd be too ashamed...

547
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,000
Let's go! We can do this!

548
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,140
Thank you...

549
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,220
SOUTH

550
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,800
The DMZ gates are open.

551
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:01,220
...but we wanted-- take off,
so we decided-- go on a trip.

552
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:10,070
Eat plenty, take tons of photos,
experience everything, and have...

553
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,760
MINES

554
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,080
I will die on my own terms...

555
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,150
...and live on my own terms.

556
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,180
We should go around, sir.

557
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,470
MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE

558
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,560
MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE

559
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:33,970
I thought I'd never see you again.

560
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,890
Do you know what I just stepped on?

561
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,599
Give me your gun,
then I'll let you go.

562
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,949
That'd be wrong.

563
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,500
Give it to me at once.

564
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,680
You can head back
and I'll be on my way.

565
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,160
You'll head back that way.

566
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,220
No, it's this way.

567
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,420
Kyu-nam, you think the South
will be paradise?

568
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:12,920
Do you think they'll let you be free,
not caring where you're from?

569
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,380
No such paradise exists.

570
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,620
At least I can fail.

571
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,949
Doing things that I want to do
and failing...

572
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,450
...trying again and failing some more...

573
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,500
Isn't that great?

574
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,220
We can't even fail here...

575
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,620
...I'm going there to fail
as much as I desire.

576
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:43,650
You think there was nothing
I wanted to do?

577
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,520
It's about just living.

578
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,600
Struggling is futile.

579
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:59,320
I'll find out if that's true
if I challenge myself.

580
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,310
Aren't you glad that I tried?

581
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,380
Piano bro...

582
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,520
Do whatever you want to do.

583
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,470
What do you know, asshole!

584
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,130
What the hell do you know?

585
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,640
Not a damn thing!

586
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
Die! Just die!

587
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,780
Don't follow me.

588
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:45,930
Compatriots of North Korea,
this is the Sound of Freedom.

589
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:53,180
This bell represents freedom,
peace and hope.

590
01:20:54,020 --> 01:21:00,430
South Korea promises you
happiness and freedom.

591
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:08,060
If you have hope,
don't be afraid to knock.

592
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:40,390
TELEPHONE FOR DEFECTORS

593
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,914
North Korean People's Army,
Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam, I wish to defect!

594
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,186
SOUTH KOREA WELCOMES YOU

595
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,440
SOUTHERN LIMIT LINE

596
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,180
Go...

597
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,130
...and fail as much as you want.

598
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,440
If you attack, you'll be shot!

599
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,240
You are violating a UN
peacekeeping treaty!

600
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,180
If you fire,
we will respond forcefully!

601
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:19,610
Did you request defection?

602
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:37,850
I wish to defect...

TENACIOUS EXPLORER

FEAR A MEANINGLESS LIFE,
NOT DEATH ITSELF

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

607
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,430

608
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,220
MAKE THE WORLD REVERE US

609
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,090

610
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:24,050
"Hello. I am..."

YOUTH TRAVEL INITIATIVE

612
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:35,070
SUMMER TRAVEL PACKAGE PROPOSAL

613
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,780
Hello, Dong-hyuk's mother.

614
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:54,579
Whenever Dong-hyuk
went into the DMZ...

615
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,290
...he'd not only catch rabbits...

616
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:01,470
...but even a boar one time,
and fed the entire base..

617
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:07,180
Everyone greased their tummies
for once, and we all had diarrhea...

618
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:10,620
And he was so accurate
with predicting weather.

619
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,790
Whenever Dong-hyuk
wanted to do laundry...

620
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,240
My boy should be doing well, right?

621
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:32,980
Of course,
he should be living a happy life.

622
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:40,840
We got a handwritten letter for once.

623
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:44,420
I lived a long time
by sacrificing so much.

624
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:49,830
I wasted away days on end
without a shred of ambition.

625
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,750
But I had this thought
of wanting something...

626
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:57,870
...even if it's very small,
that I can accomplish on my own.

627
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:02,060
I guess I wanted to see me
in that state.

628
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,050
That was my dream.

629
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:09,050
So did I achieve my dream?
Am I happy?

630
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,400
I honestly don't know.

631
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:17,079
Life is still difficult,
and I sometimes cry for no reason.

632
01:29:17,179 --> 01:29:19,579
YOUR YOUTH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN APPROVED.

633
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,580
But I work up my strength
at that moment.

634
01:29:22,931 --> 01:29:25,580
I can't just stay put.

635
01:29:26,215 --> 01:29:31,935
That why I'm happy right now.

636
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:39,032
Thank you, Amundsen.
Here's the song you requested.

637
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:41,461
"Be happy."
