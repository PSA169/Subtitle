A CAPER FILM PRODUCTION

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,715
A CHOI DONG HOON FILM

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,181
<i>When I was young, I came
to this place from the future.</i>

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,021
<i>From ages past,</i>

6
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>aliens had locked up their prisoners
in human bodies.</i>

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:15,366
<i>It was Guard and Thunder's job
to oversee the prisoners.</i>

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:25,293
<i>One day, the leader of the prisoners,
the Controller, escaped.</i>

9
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>He released the alien atmosphere
"haava" over the city,</i>

10
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>and many people died.</i>

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>Inside that cloud,
alien prisoners were awakened.</i>

12
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>The Controller's goal
was to explode the remaining haava</i>

13
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,246
<i>and replace Earth's atmosphere.</i>

14
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:08,586
<i>All people would die,
and Earth would become theirs.</i>

15
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,506
<i>48 minutes to the haava explosions...</i>

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,676
Let's go to another time.

17
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,638
<i>We need to trap the aliens
in another time and come back</i>

18
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>to stop the haava explosions.</i>

19
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,562
What is that?

20
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,321
Dad!

21
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,370
Ean, come back and find me!

22
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,540
We have to stop the haava from exploding!

23
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,755
<i>In this place, Guard was destroyed
and Thunder stopped working.</i>

24
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>To return to the future,
I need the Divine Blade.</i>

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:07,228
<i>After ten years, I found the Blade.</i>

26
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,027
So beautiful!

27
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,782
But have we met before?

28
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,579
The wicked girl is shooting thunder!

29
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,540
<i>Everyone was trying
to find the Divine Blade.</i>

30
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,626
<i>A</i> dosa <i>hack.</i>

31
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,753
<i>Two sorcerers.</i>

32
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,338
<i>And the alien prisoners.</i>

33
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,885
<i>And then...</i>

34
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,513
<i>I finally got the Blade.</i>

35
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,599
Right Paw, Left Paw! Follow her!

36
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:59,572
Something inside you...

37
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,199
What's inside me?

38
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,767
The Girl Who Shoots Thunder
vanished with the Blade. What now?

39
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,811
We need the Divine Blade.

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,481
Search for the Girl.

41
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:42,323
<i>Now, I must find the spacecraft
and Thunder, and return to the future.</i>

42
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,869
<i>To stop the haava from exploding.</i>

43
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:55,795
ALIENOID: RETURN TO THE FUTURE

44
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,394
A bowl of soup,
and dried fish for the road!

45
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,311
Yes!

46
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,441
Long time no see.
What rumors do you hear about me?

47
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
"The Girl is headed to Big Rahn Inn,

48
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,072
so take the Divine Blade from her
for a huge reward."

49
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,033
Why the mustache?

50
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,995
It belongs to a guy I met once.
Perfect disguise, right?

51
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,873
Perfect or not, what will you do?

52
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,793
It's four days to Big Rahn Inn
and you can't let your guard down.

53
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,503
How long since you've slept?

54
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,673
Two days. No big deal.

55
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,427
- Did you find what I asked for?
- Of course!

56
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,182
I asked all the fishermen along that river
where the Blade was found,

57
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,311
and I found someone
who saw this iron thing.

58
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,397
You said it was this small?

59
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,236
Long time no see, Thunder.

60
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,280
He's still alive then.

61
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,116
Alive? You said it's iron.

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,452
He's an adorable and mysterious being.

63
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,245
Who saw him?

64
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,750
Two woodcutter brothers
who live near Yellow Mountain.

65
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,127
But the problem is...

66
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,799
Watch out for them.

67
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,679
If I find it, where should I go?

68
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,058
The river by Big Rahn Inn.
Where the Iron Wagon is stuck.

69
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,559
The Iron Wagon!

70
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,854
We are the fabulous shaman <i>dosa</i>!

71
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,689
And you are?

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,786
So it is you!

73
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,455
Fixing a mustache to that pretty face.

74
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,626
It won't be so pretty
after we smash it into the ground!

75
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,253
What are you doing with that?

76
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,798
I'm trying to decide whether to ram it
down your throats or not.

77
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,927
But bluster and lies are part
of human nature, so I'll show mercy.

78
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,015
Life is precious, why not just go?
Keep your heads on your necks.

79
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,145
Is that the best you can do?
What an amateur!

80
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,409
This bitch needs to be taught a lesson!

81
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,287
I'll skin you alive
and grind your bones into powder!

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,067
That's hot!

83
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,697
Hot!

84
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,657
- Stop chasing me.
- Okay!

85
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,245
If I see you again, I'll use the thunder.

86
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,706
Okay!

87
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,345
Look at you two.

88
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
Stop following me!

89
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,077
Ten years ago, that night!

90
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,664
What did Master Hyun say
after he was found in the forest?

91
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,125
A monster inside him.
I said kill him, you said no.

92
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,670
We just had to block his energy.

93
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,464
By giving him that fan
with two swords inside.

94
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,967
Remember? In Master Hyun's room.

95
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,600
What did he meet by the river?
There's something scary inside him.

96
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,104
That's why we should kill him.
Or it will be trouble later.

97
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:27,692
No, we can just stop training him.
Let the boy live his life.

98
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,193
We'll give him this fan.

99
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,989
It has two swords too heavy to lift.
That will block his energy.

100
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,200
What if he pulls them out?
Then he'll be unstoppable.

101
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,077
No one besides us can do that.

102
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,329
And if he does, we'll kill him then.

103
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,541
But he pulled them out,
so he must have learned magic.

104
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,418
Should we kill him then?

105
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,171
But was he that disciple?
Looks like a thief to me.

106
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,799
If I touch him, I'll know for sure.

107
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,598
Where am I?

108
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,643
You don't remember?

109
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,980
You pulled a sword out of that fan
and killed a monster.

110
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,524
Jajang... Jajang!

111
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,984
Jajang!

112
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,402
Where's Jajang?

113
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,157
Why ask her? She's deaf and dumb.

114
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,580
Let me ask you something, madam.

115
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,957
Where did Jajang come from?

116
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,878
A brush!

117
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,387
Ten years ago...

118
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,061
Yellow Mountain?

119
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,985
- Check if he's alive!
- Yes, sir!

120
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,039
Where am I?

121
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,168
This is Secret Temple.
We train as <i>dosa</i> in this place.

122
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,253
I'm lost.

123
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,048
Trapped in time!

124
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,550
We are all trapped in time.

125
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,429
I do not know your story,
but will you wear this?

126
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,265
The mask's name is Jajang.

127
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,851
Such an amusing human.

128
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,111
It's a monster!

129
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,913
My eyes...

130
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,873
From now on,

131
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,836
I'm going to rule this place.

132
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,341
Why does Jajang seek the Divine Blade?

133
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,887
TIME

134
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,057
We're trapped in time.

135
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,477
Whose body did the Controller enter?

136
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,815
On the day the Controller
entered a new body,

137
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,110
four humans were present.

138
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,321
MASTER HYUN, MR. BLUE
MADAM BLACK, DOG TURD

139
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,657
Only he can handle the divine blade.

140
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,243
We must find the Controller and go back.

141
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,497
Why stay in that diseased body?

142
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,834
Find a healthy body to occupy.

143
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,046
Then I lose my memory.

144
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,304
The Controller is in someone's body?

145
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,264
How does it come out?

146
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,685
We must pierce three humans
with the Divine Blade.

147
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,613
The Divine Blade... if it cuts you,
the Controller comes out?

148
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,658
Madam! Jajang killed Master Hyun, right?

149
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,661
And he tried to pierce us too?

150
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:13,542
The disciple was there that day too.
Jajang doesn't know.

151
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,378
Let's grab the disciple first.

152
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,139
Where did he go?

153
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,977
We should kill him
before the monster comes out!

154
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,104
Chase him. He can't be far off.

155
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,693
So...

156
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,864
What's this, you ask?

157
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:48,160
Ginseng from Mt. Guwol ground,
boiled with ox bezoar and musk!

158
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,579
I call this medicine

159
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,457
the Elixir of Eternal Vigor!

160
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,838
The man here can't see,
but three years ago he couldn't walk!

161
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,467
He's none other than
the famous warrior Nong-pa!

162
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,636
Let's see his swordsmanship.

163
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,025
I almost met my maker.

164
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,446
- Now, I'd like to offer you all...
- Wait!

165
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,156
I'm not convinced!

166
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,037
I feel no power in your sword.

167
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,582
Show me your swordplay then!

168
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,750
What can I show a blind man?

169
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,130
A 200-year old sword.

170
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,799
Listen to it sing.

171
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:49,054
Having drawn this sword,
only one of us can leave alive!

172
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,854
This is the kingdom's greatest saber,
made by the Sorcerers of Twin Peaks.

173
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,739
Hello, great warrior Nong-pa.
Do you remember us?

174
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,450
Your voice sounds like
you've taken a beating.

175
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,702
Please sell us that saber.

176
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,788
You bought it from
the Sorcerers after all.

177
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,499
Even if I sold it to you,
could you wield it?

178
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,463
I was good with the sword today.
Did you sell a lot of elixir?

179
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,590
It's not your sword that sells it.

180
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,217
It's the way you humiliate the rich man.

181
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,095
How was my acting today?

182
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,765
I got properly beaten, right?

183
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,392
Who are you? New team members?

184
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,019
What's with the silver?

185
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,937
Nothing in life is free!

186
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,608
We need the saber to take
the Divine Blade from that Girl.

187
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,568
Before Secret Temple gets it.

188
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,529
Secret Temple seeks the Blade? Jajang?

189
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,452
My eyes!

190
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,085
Let's see if the blade heals my eyes.

191
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,672
The Bitch Who Shoots Thunder is dead now!

192
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,757
We'll show you the way.

193
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,763
So yesterday, two cats tumbled here
and jumped up there? Is that right?

194
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,807
Who cares about cats?

195
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,185
Yesterday, the Girl Who Shoots Thunder
wrecked the place with her brawling.

196
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,854
Brawling? She is a tough one.

197
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,191
So they came this way and ran off there.

198
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,903
A bowl of soup for me. And rice wine!

199
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,987
Yes.

200
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,078
<i>So I need the Divine Blade
to find out what's inside me...</i>

201
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,544
Where could Muruk have gone?

202
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,129
I feel he's nearby.

203
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,049
There he is!

204
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,721
Look at him pigging out there.

205
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,516
He eats like that because
of the monster inside. Let's kill him.

206
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,310
Or we can kill him
after identifying the monster.

207
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,938
Trick him into being your disciple,
then check his pulse...

208
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,565
I'll know for sure!

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,736
But make him your disciple, not mine.

210
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,161
Madam, two bowls of soup. Oh my!

211
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,915
Can this be a coincidence?
Imagine meeting you here!

212
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,376
No such thing as coincidence, only fate.

213
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,297
We didn't introduce ourselves.
We are the Sorcerers of Twin Peaks.

214
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,468
In the West, they refer
to people like us as alchemists.

215
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,054
So let me check your pulse points.

216
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,639
- Your name is?
- Muruk.

217
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,891
Muruk...

218
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,148
How is it?

219
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,611
It's so soft.

220
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,741
Not like that! I've gone soft for him.

221
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,536
No! How can that be?
I've been chaste for 150 years.

222
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,456
A fan is wide when unfurled
and narrow when folded.

223
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,251
Thus, that which does not exist
may also exist, and vice versa.

224
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,046
- What?
- What a dunce. Let me demonstrate.

225
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,714
We made this fan.

226
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,385
We put in decent weapons
and a winter wind.

227
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,346
What are these cats? I didn't draw them.

228
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,597
I drew them.

229
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,435
Don't fan it, or the cats turn human.

230
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,193
What? Who are you?

231
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,615
They're coming! This way, Miss.

232
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,575
- But who are you?
- Hurry!

233
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,494
Those men have been chasing you
since yesterday.

234
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,833
- Where are we going?
- This way...

235
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,466
Hurry! Up the wall!

236
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,471
I'm asking who you are.

237
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,307
He's Right Paw, I'm Left Paw.
We're humans.

238
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,225
Humans?

239
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,102
- And cats too.
- Cats?

240
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,904
Where are the cats?

241
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,241
The cats are chasing the Girl,
and I'm chasing the cats.

242
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,034
I'd better be going.

243
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,080
But you know, your energy is blocked here.

244
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,666
Which means there's something in you!

245
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,212
There's a monster inside you!

246
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,762
I can't let go!

247
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,056
It's draining my energy!

248
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,319
Out of the way! I can't control my body!

249
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,695
Why is it doing this?

250
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,864
Everyone, look out!

251
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,909
I said block his energy,
did you release it?

252
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,494
Somebody stop me!

253
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,664
No!

254
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,751
Where am I going?

255
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,377
Hey!

256
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,508
I stopped!

257
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,648
Muruk, you can't run from us.

258
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,818
Stop right there!

259
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:45,869
Muruk, you shall move in tandem with me!

260
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,486
Shall I tell you something?

261
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,322
Master Hyun, your teacher,
gave up training you!

262
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,034
Why? Because he learned
there's a monster in you.

263
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,506
Wait for us!

264
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,133
Why are you following me?

265
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,010
Because our master told us to.

266
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,136
Your master?

267
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,221
What? You don't know our master?

268
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,765
- You're married to him!
- He'll come to find us soon.

269
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,559
Wait, he's coming here?

270
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,062
Tell him we can meet
when the weather is nicer.

271
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,939
That's not right! You're married!

272
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,358
Married? Don't be ridiculous.

273
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,277
If you share a wedding night,
you're married.

274
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,903
A wedding night?

275
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,614
Why am I talking about this?

276
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,284
I knew it. They failed
on their wedding night.

277
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,453
You should try again when you're sober.

278
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,163
What's with you two?

279
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,832
You're cats who live in that man's fan?

280
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,710
But have we met somewhere before?

281
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,004
Don't hit on me like a dog!

282
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,089
I'm offended. We're cats.

283
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,762
Have a nice day.

284
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,515
Tell that man thank you,
and that I'll cherish our memories.

285
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,267
Bye, kitties.

286
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,103
Don't follow me!

287
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,230
Why not tell your husband yourself?

288
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,565
He's not my husband!

289
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,027
Oh my, we're going that way too.
She'll misunderstand.

290
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,946
We'll just forge ahead.
But when will Muruk arrive?

291
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,991
Let's kill him.
See if the monster comes out.

292
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,828
I'm against violence.

293
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,455
And I'm in favor?

294
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,250
Why change your mind?
I'm sure something is in him!

295
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,047
Madam, a pitcher of alcohol please!

296
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,466
Two pitchers!

297
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,512
I can't do this sober. Let's drink first.

298
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,097
Madam! Just a minute.

299
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,272
Your knife... here.

300
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,277
What's this?

301
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,780
- Is the food for that room?
- Yes.

302
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,825
- Entertain them in there.
- But they said no one...

303
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,786
- It's fine. They love culture.
- What's that?

304
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,871
What?

305
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,834
What's that doing there?

306
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,766
TAVERN

307
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,853
Oh my, so much?

308
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,105
Don't let anyone in.

309
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,857
Very well.

310
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,010
What will you do with just one gun?

311
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,012
And this one?

312
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,922
That way!

313
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,123
Who are you?

314
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,875
Are you from Secret Temple?

315
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,794
The arrows sounded familiar.
Is Jajang here?

316
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,213
Nong-pa! The one who was expelled!

317
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,448
Nong-pa is the best!

318
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,386
The Divine Blade...

319
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
They say it heals people.

320
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,894
Who are you?

321
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,772
Is this part a faded gold color?

322
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,109
And here, a bright blue light.

323
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,529
I thought you were blind. Who are you?

324
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,823
I saw it once before.

325
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,619
A man wearing strange armor had it.

326
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,038
Then he disappeared into the light.

327
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,879
You saw that?

328
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,881
Who are you?

329
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,386
Why do you have this?

330
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,145
She deserves it, that's why!
She'll save people with it.

331
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,229
Who are you?

332
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,780
I'm that maiden's husband.

333
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,178
The Bitch Who Shoots Thunder!

334
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,226
Where did she go?

335
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,156
Look at this thief. Stealing my magic?

336
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,409
Thief? We're just learning
from each other.

337
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,003
You're that hack! Do you have the Blade?

338
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,674
Miss! I'm fine, so run away! Hurry!

339
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,385
She left already?

340
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,221
Guess so.

341
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,766
Who's running?
Isn't this the Sorcerers' curtain?

342
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,476
I pinched it.

343
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,772
They vanished in the curtain!

344
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,366
How did you get the Sorcerers' curtain?

345
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,995
They're right here!

346
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,961
Damn it. Why do you keep dropping things?

347
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,546
Because you pushed me!

348
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,549
- Don't mind us! We're just passing by...
- Quiet!

349
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,176
- He said be quiet!
- We'll wake up all the neighbors.

350
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,220
Sir, I'm terribly sorry!

351
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,846
Did you commit a big sin?

352
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,140
Just tell the whole world, will you?

353
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,644
I've got snapper bones stuck in my throat.

354
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,229
We ate it together.
You think you're the only one?

355
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:07,699
But I need to find that Blade
if it can heal my eyes.

356
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,293
2022, SEOUL

357
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,155
Hey, with you staring at me like that,

358
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,781
I can't drink my tea.

359
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,159
Stop worrying.

360
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:55,330
The thing you're worried about
hasn't happened. Not yet.

361
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,377
Anyway, I'm fine.

362
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,797
And the world is at peace.

363
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,427
Even if I wanted to use
what's in this bag, there's no need.

364
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,512
See you tomorrow, Ancestor.

365
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,606
TWO DAYS BEFORE HAAVA EXPLOSION

366
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,039
Grab him!

367
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,123
Catch him!

368
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,127
You bastard!

369
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,483
- What's with you?
- Me?

370
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,654
Just going home
after getting some exercise.

371
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,781
Where are you going, dirty thief?

372
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,449
Go to hell.

373
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,662
You hit me first.

374
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,728
Did you catch him, miss?

375
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,357
It seems my fellow officers
could use some help.

376
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,026
What station are you from?

377
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,281
Me? I'm from... the service.

378
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,574
Give me your phone.

379
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,576
The service?

380
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,995
National Intelligence Service?

381
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,789
The Customs Service.

382
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,084
I'm a customs officer, smuggling division.

383
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,836
Call if you need a witness.

384
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,425
Is he a smuggler?

385
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,343
You can tell by the shape?

386
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,847
If it's for swallowing,
they make it into that poop shape.

387
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,558
Guess I'll need your number.
What's your name?

388
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,602
You have to request my name at...

389
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,062
- Officer Kang Choon-seop.
- Yes.

390
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,939
- Take my call.
- Okay.

391
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,777
JISAN HOSPITAL

392
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,327
Where am I?

393
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,455
This is Jisan Hospital.
No talking except when it's treatment.

394
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,499
Does it hurt when I press here?

395
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,625
Oh my god!

396
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,211
My neck is broken, right? Am I paralyzed?

397
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,171
Be thankful it's not fractured.

398
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,591
Then I won't be here long.
When will I be sent to the police?

399
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,134
Mr. Gu Sam-sik.

400
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,764
I told you, no talking allowed.

401
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,657
Wow, nice clouds.

402
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,369
ONE DAY BEFORE HAAVA EXPLOSION

403
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,514
The prisoner transport ship is here.

404
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,964
What is this?

405
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,929
Hey! Go away!

406
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,375
Hey!

407
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,420
What the hell?

408
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,965
Name, Gu Sam-sik. Nine convictions.
I'll pay him a visit.

409
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,800
Bye.

410
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,640
Officer Kang Choon-seop!
You came in person?

411
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,351
We're just on a visit.
Not too many questions.

412
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,688
What is it?

413
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,941
I know that girl.

414
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,070
Let's do our visit.

415
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,405
Hold on. Why is the door open?

416
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,493
- We came in the front door?
- Yes.

417
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,869
The back door and the parking lot, quick!

418
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,797
Why was Ean here?

419
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,884
What did you say to her?

420
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,970
Maybe she overheard us talking?

421
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,183
Find her. She recorded
all this on her phone.

422
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:52,228
She went to her friend's house.

423
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,897
What was her friend's name?

424
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,900
She has just one friend.
Born July 17, 2011.

425
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,695
Searching for her address.
Name, Kim Min-sun.

426
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,240
Kim Min-sun? My niece?

427
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,796
Oh my god!
This video is from the hospital?

428
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,174
- That's your dad? You shot it yourself?
- Yeah.

429
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,469
Aunt!

430
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,013
Yeah?

431
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,140
Oh, you're here, Ean?

432
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,642
Ean is sleeping over. She ran away.

433
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,145
- How are you?
- I'm fine, as always.

434
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,064
But if you ran away, your dad...

435
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,942
But your dad's car...

436
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,363
Is that true? Is it really
a talking car made by NASA?

437
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,367
I think I heard your dad talking to it.

438
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,245
But how can a car talk?

439
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,622
Right...

440
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,125
- Yeah.
- Why are you in my room?

441
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,300
Well, enjoy yourselves then.

442
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,593
Such cute kids!

443
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,456
What is this?

444
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,420
Sam-sik?

445
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,398
THE DAY OF THE HAAVA EXPLOSION

446
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,164
That red dot is the bike Sam-sik stole.

447
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,127
These days, deliveries are tracked
by GPS. 3km away.

448
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,756
What's that?

449
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,968
Seems there was an accident.

450
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,141
Looks good.

451
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,433
Give me some peanuts.

452
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,979
What's going on?

453
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,754
What's with those cars?

454
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,175
What is it? This is no ordinary accident.

455
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,555
Run, quick!

456
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,057
Hurry up!

457
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,977
What is that thing?

458
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,771
Sam-sik must be in there.

459
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:05,731
<i>It's not clear where this red gas
was released from, or what it's made of.</i>

460
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,651
<i>The polluted zone has stopped expanding,</i>

461
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,945
<i>and police have blocked off the area.</i>

462
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:15,866
<i>This drone footage shows
two survivors in the polluted zone.</i>

463
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,535
<i>In that cloud where so many people died,</i>

464
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,207
<i>how two people were able to survive
remains a mystery.</i>

465
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,086
What? I saw that man
in the video that Ean shot!

466
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:31,715
<i>The two men hijacked an ambulance
and their whereabouts are unknown.</i>

467
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,217
2 SURVIVORS' WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

468
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>Police have not determined
if there are any more survivors...</i>

469
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,806
Min-sun, stay at home. I'll be back.

470
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,898
The time you spoke of has come, Ancestor.

471
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,949
- What's this?
- I'm a public servant too!

472
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,326
Hello, everyone.

473
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,454
Can you connect this video? It's urgent.

474
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,791
Who's in charge here?

475
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,043
Who are you?

476
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,005
First, look at this video.
This is at Jisan Hospital.

477
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,425
This man is the first survivor
in the polluted zone.

478
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,637
And the second survivor.

479
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:23,851
Both were at Jisan Hospital.
No way this is a coincidence.

480
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,521
There's one more.
Sam-sik was at the hospital too.

481
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:29,940
- He may become the third survivor...
- Who's Sam-sik?

482
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:34,361
He's a smuggler we're chasing,
and he's in the polluted zone.

483
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,571
Who are you two?

484
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,615
I'm Min Gaelin, Customs Officer.

485
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,160
But the key thing is who shot this video.

486
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,746
Her name is Ean,
one of my niece's friends.

487
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,623
And her dad is... really strange...

488
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,791
Okay.

489
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,210
Customs? All right.

490
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,839
You know how many videos like that
are on the Internet now?

491
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,341
They're all fake.

492
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,593
You let anyone in here?

493
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:01,638
Just a minute.

494
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,683
- Hello?
- This is Ean's dad.

495
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,226
MIN-SUN'S AUNT

496
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,436
<i>Yes, go ahead!</i>

497
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,064
Can Ean stay at your house for a few days?

498
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,816
Well...

499
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,236
Sure, yes... Min-sun would like that too.

500
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,323
Should I pick her up? I'll be done soon.

501
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,908
<i>No, I'll send her now.</i>

502
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,659
Thanks for your kindness.

503
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,744
Sure!

504
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,459
- Move this news van.
- Toss me the key!

505
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,879
I'll drive. Who was that?

506
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,549
The dad of the kid who shot the video.
Or her stepfather.

507
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,843
Anyway, let me get my weapons.

508
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,761
Let's go!

509
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,929
Golf clubs are your weapons?

510
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,889
No, I suck at golf.

511
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:44,973
Let's go!

512
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,115
He lives here?

513
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,533
It's the right address.

514
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,286
Min-sun, Ean is coming over.

515
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,249
So stay at home, don't go out.
I'll be back soon.

516
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,842
Is that the stolen ambulance?

517
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,345
That way!

518
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,611
Okay. Now, detonate
all the haava inside it.

519
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,288
What's that?

520
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,090
Another car is coming.

521
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,858
Choon-seop!

522
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,031
That's hot!

523
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,118
Min Gaelin?

524
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,328
Ean's dad...

525
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,663
Hide!

526
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,780
Ready to transport!

527
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,616
We can come back
and stop the haava from exploding.

528
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,909
Let's go to another time.

529
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,756
What is that?

530
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,240
<i>So ten years ago, that's how you came
from the future to here?</i>

531
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,081
You came after me for this?

532
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,917
Why do you want it? For the money?

533
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,296
Why do I need that Blade?

534
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,550
How far back
does the wheel of fortune turn?

535
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,762
This isn't the first time I've saved you.

536
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,307
Your name is Ean, right?

537
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,395
Who are you? How do you know my name?

538
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,565
Remember when we were kids?
I saved you from drowning.

539
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,276
You?

540
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:29,489
It won't be easy,
but imagine me as a child.

541
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,590
What's your name? I'm Muruk.

542
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,716
Ean.

543
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,301
Ean.

544
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,553
Ean...

545
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,724
- You were that little kid?
- Little? You...

546
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,602
You lived.

547
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,397
What was your name? Murky, or something...

548
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,066
Muruk, not murky...

549
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,527
So shouldn't you repay me
for saving your life?

550
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,572
Thanks to you, I found this.

551
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,159
I've always wanted to see you again.

552
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,286
So you were that boy...

553
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,334
But what's the Controller?

554
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,006
How do you know that?

555
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,592
Where did you hear it?

556
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,513
The day I saved you and went up the hill,

557
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,139
I saw something strange.

558
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,353
He came to me, looking for a human body.

559
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,859
I found it... a human.

560
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,577
That monster is inside me?

561
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,707
I can't remember what happened after.

562
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,713
If the Blade cuts me,
the monster comes out.

563
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,673
When it does, you kill it.

564
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,008
Don't!

565
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:17,222
Whatever is inside you,
just leave it alone.

566
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,891
And just live your life.

567
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,478
Just live my life?

568
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,522
Then what am I?

569
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,358
If a monster is inside me...

570
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,491
So I need to die for the monster to die?

571
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,454
You're fated to kill me.

572
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:46,001
I could have been fated to die as a baby.

573
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,421
Why did I survive?

574
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,718
I was saved by Dad, Thunder,

575
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,804
and by you.

576
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,349
So that I could save others.

577
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,395
Whatever is inside you,

578
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,315
you are just you.

579
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,194
I'm just a hack.

580
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,573
That's good. Muruk the hack.

581
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,534
That's you. Don't forget it.

582
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,079
I won't forget you either.

583
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,713
Come on, shake my hand.

584
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,596
I'll take the Blade now.

585
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,454
Did you find the Dog Turd fellow
from Yellow Mountain?

586
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,958
We're in pursuit.

587
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,629
Bring him to me.
And move that wagon to Big Rahn Inn.

588
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,675
And the Girl Who Shoots Thunder?

589
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,387
Wait. She'll come for this anyway.

590
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:40,031
Imagine meeting as kids and seeing
each other again. Fate is so strange.

591
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,868
Like a pine tree by the courtyard.

592
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,078
What does that mean?

593
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,123
One person is a courtyard,
and the other is a pine tree.

594
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:53,086
All that time, it was just a pine tree
by the courtyard.

595
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:56,006
Nothing is coincidence.
It's all fate. Us too.

596
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,175
Wow, how do I know all that?

597
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,094
You're talking nonsense!

598
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,346
Then where did your pine tree go?

599
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,933
Did she go to find that thing?
It looks like a crooked pot.

600
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,563
That Thunder thing she asked Dog Turd
to find, it was painted on that wall.

601
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,065
There was something else in that hut too.

602
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,859
Behind the hanging mat...

603
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,777
Shouldn't we tell her?

604
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,505
It's the caped <i>dosa</i>!

605
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,549
They must be chasing the Girl.

606
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:44,054
Jajang offered a huge reward.
Shouldn't we grab her first?

607
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,263
What should we do?

608
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,891
They say the Girl is so pretty.

609
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,727
Before killing her, let's hold her hand!

610
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,774
I heard she's married. To a dimwitted oaf.

611
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,362
God, I'm drunk! Let's chase after her too.

612
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:01,947
Oh my!

613
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,451
What are you looking at,
you dimwitted oaf!

614
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,085
Who's calling me dimwitted?

615
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:19,506
There's a line in the Lotus Sutra.
<i>"Hoe-ja-jeong-ri geo-ja-pil-ban."</i>

616
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,716
You're a fount of learning tonight!

617
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,343
So, "Those who part meet again?"

618
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,845
"Who cares about saving face?"

619
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,306
- Left Paw!
- Her scent is this way.

620
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,391
Let's go.

621
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,730
She went that way.

622
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,399
He's got a good nose.

623
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,165
I thought she was dead. Should I wake her?

624
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,668
She'll be cold like that.

625
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,385
It's okay. It's us.

626
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,389
All the <i>dosa</i> in the kingdom
are searching for you.

627
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,726
How many days since you slept?

628
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,810
Three days.

629
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,481
Why did you come back?
We agreed not to meet.

630
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,109
We did, that's true.

631
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,695
But some promises are better broken.

632
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,489
And we wanted to tell you
about that object you seek.

633
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,450
- What object?
- That...

634
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,743
- Thunder.
- Thunder.

635
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,827
Thunder.

636
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,287
You know where it is?

637
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,935
RUN AWAY, YOU FOOL

638
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,357
Where's Thunder?

639
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,862
It's a nice drawing.

640
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,490
You wanted to show me a drawing?

641
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,158
No, this.

642
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,687
Muruk! Come out. Give her some time.

643
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,984
Thunder, you waited long, right?

644
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,363
Thunder?

645
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,240
Thunder?

646
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,077
Is Thunder alive?

647
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,162
Yes.

648
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:01,042
Energy... he lost his energy,
so he's not responding.

649
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,128
Then where did his energy go?

650
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,345
It's that guy... It's him!

651
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,181
Look over there.

652
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,350
It's me.

653
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:20,895
It's those men from long ago!

654
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,400
I'm looking at you.

655
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,242
You two! Come here. Don't hide!

656
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,452
Run away! Run!

657
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,370
Wait!

658
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:38,580
Wait for me!

659
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,583
What?

660
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,714
Stop there!

661
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,217
Let's go find the spacecraft, Thunder.
We need to go home.

662
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,553
Here.

663
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,847
Now, are you going to that future?

664
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,806
Yes.

665
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,894
So we're parting again?

666
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,359
Watch out for the cats.
They may chase after you.

667
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,696
No, I'll be firm with them.

668
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,824
Those rascals keep running after you.

669
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,038
I need to teach them a lesson.
I'll be firm with them.

670
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,208
Right Paw! Left Paw!

671
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,377
Where did you go?

672
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,387
They came back!

673
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,974
How did you two know I was here?

674
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,519
- You know them? These are the woodcutters.
- You know us too?

675
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,772
Of course, Left Paw and Right Paw.

676
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,649
Who is Left Paw and Right Paw?

677
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,526
Those men we saw ten years ago
have re-appeared!

678
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,611
Really?

679
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,905
What was ten years ago about?

680
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,243
Stop!

681
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,871
- Who are you two?
- Stay away!

682
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,333
Tell me!

683
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,587
Save us... What did we do wrong?

684
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,632
Ten years ago,
it was just a coincidence we met here.

685
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,469
Met here?

686
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,806
Us?

687
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,854
Ten years ago, here?

688
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,736
- Dog Turd!
- Right Paw!

689
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,114
What are you doing here?
Did you see Left Paw?

690
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,240
Yes, I did.

691
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,451
I've got something to tell you.

692
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,331
Don't go. You must not go.
I heard something.

693
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,419
- The thing is...
- Are you Dog Turd?

694
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,379
Yes, why?

695
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,506
- Come with us.
- Where?

696
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,218
- To Big Rahn Inn.
- Why there?

697
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,512
Let go!

698
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,611
Right Paw!

699
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,669
Left Paw!

700
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,348
Right Paw, something feels weird.

701
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,974
No, you're fine.

702
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,976
Muruk is here.

703
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,979
Left Paw, what's wrong?

704
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,315
The caped <i>dosa</i> snatched away
Dog Turd, then...

705
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,650
Get up, Left Paw. Let's go.

706
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,741
Left Paw, what's wrong? Left Paw!

707
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,081
Why am I disappearing? I must be dying.

708
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,499
Go back in the fan.

709
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,543
Left Paw.

710
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
Thunder?

711
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,349
Are you awake?

712
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,565
Left Paw!

713
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:43,783
Thunder...

714
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:50,373
Right Paw, did Left Paw die?

715
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,875
Dog Turd seems to know something.

716
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:54,877
Muruk.

717
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,755
Let's go to Big Rahn Inn.

718
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:04,345
BIG RAHN INN

719
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:13,312
I brought Dog Turd,
so tell Jajang to settle my reward!

720
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:18,568
Ten years ago, Master Hyun
had a young disciple?

721
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,239
Possessed by a monster and sent away.

722
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,157
RECORDS OF MASTER HYUN

723
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,409
After giving him a fan...

724
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,176
Hey, did someone move the Iron Wagon?

725
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,137
Jajang moved it
to Big Rahn Inn last night.

726
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,685
It's Big Rahn Inn.

727
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,689
Let's go in.

728
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,195
If Muruk is chasing Jajang,
he must be here.

729
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,911
This feels odd. Why is no one here?

730
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:13,789
Hello?

731
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,000
Hello?

732
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,671
The caped <i>dosa</i>. Why are they all dead?

733
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,799
Even the Secret Temple <i>dosa</i>!

734
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,977
Nong-pa, you scoundrel! Why are you here?

735
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,648
You sorcerers call everyone "scoundrel".

736
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,026
Because you didn't pay us
for that saber, scoundrel!

737
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,779
Why are those scoundrels dead?

738
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,615
They were dead when I arrived.
There's a monster here.

739
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:48,699
Jajang?

740
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,993
You came for him too?

741
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,078
Where is he?

742
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,746
Hiding, for sure.

743
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:54,914
Wait!

744
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,666
I hear someone upstairs.

745
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,255
It's bait.

746
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,173
For whom?

747
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,195
- Muruk, you scoundrel!
- Finally, we found you!

748
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,239
Jajang? Where is he?

749
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,117
Quiet down. Where's our sack?

750
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,370
Muruk.

751
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,768
Dog Turd?

752
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,937
I've been stabbed.

753
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,480
Who did it? Jajang?

754
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,691
He said I was at Yellow Mountain...

755
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,485
They took the bait.

756
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:14,368
Master Hyun had a young disciple
with a monster inside him.

757
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,954
His name was Muruk.

758
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,000
It's not Dog Turd who Jajang is after.

759
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,670
Run away, quick!

760
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,439
Those woodcutters saw you ten years ago.

761
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,816
They saw me ten years ago?

762
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,445
You came out of that thing.

763
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,571
What thing?

764
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,573
Where?

765
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,744
That thing the girl seeks.

766
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,997
Dog Turd!

767
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,056
We're here, finally.

768
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,475
What do we do now, Thunder?

769
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:24,689
Thunder!

770
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,108
Thunder!

771
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,570
The thing the girl seeks?

772
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,158
What she was looking for...

773
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,652
It's here.

774
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:12,778
It's here!

775
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,004
Right Paw! Wake up!

776
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,674
- Muruk...
- Yes?

777
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,602
Right Paw?

778
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,191
The thunder!

779
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,401
Why are you two here?

780
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,622
No!

781
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,191
No!

782
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,571
No!

783
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,949
No!

784
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,201
No!

785
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,224
I found one.

786
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:49,810
A human.

787
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,743
Muruk?

788
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,455
Muruk?

789
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,090
Why is it me?

790
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,347
Then what's inside you?

791
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,572
My functions stop.

792
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,413
Take my energy.

793
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,842
Thunder! Look after this boy.

794
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,947
What is that? A pot?

795
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,452
Capturing life forms.

796
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:16,081
Two cats, two humans.

797
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,378
Start duplication.

798
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,475
Make sure to kill me.

799
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,560
With your hands.

800
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:42,334
The Controller has escaped.

801
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:53,846
Ean!

802
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:08,986
Let's go to the future.

803
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:13,198
We'll detonate the haava
and free the prisoners.

804
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,420
Warning! Time energy is unstable.

805
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:30,090
What is that?

806
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,996
<i>47 minutes before the haava explosion,</i>

807
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,334
<i>the Controller has returned at last.</i>

808
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,962
<i>Prisoners in this zone, awaken!</i>

809
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:51,922
<i>Help the Controller.</i>

810
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:32,963
Choon-seop, Sam-sik is a survivor!

811
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,256
They're sending in medics.

812
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,340
I'll stop them.

813
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,178
Wait! The medics are in danger!

814
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,513
Pull them back,

815
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:44,308
- and send an armed SWAT team.
- What the hell?

816
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,684
Customs, again?

817
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,768
Get rid of her.

818
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:50,439
A police officer
was attacked by a monster!

819
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:54,401
Medics, if you hear me,
you can begin the operation...

820
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,029
Medics! Fall back!
The operation is canceled!

821
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,822
<i>What the hell are you doing? Get out!</i>

822
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,788
Arrest her, quick.

823
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,453
Deploy medics behind special forces.
Do you have line of sight?

824
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,291
<i>Stand by! I see something ahead.</i>

825
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,585
What is that?

826
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:55,837
<i>The survivor is floating in the air.</i>

827
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,186
What happened? Report!

828
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,718
Where are we?

829
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,804
Is this the future?

830
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,432
Has General Yi become king?

831
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:49,850
No?

832
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,228
Where are we? How do we get back?

833
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,688
We must find horses!

834
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:01,361
<i>The Divine Blade crossed into the present.</i>

835
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,072
Where is the Divine Blade now?

836
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,702
<i>12.4 North-Northwest.
Only the Blade can stop the explosion.</i>

837
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,620
<i>Take the Blade from them.</i>

838
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,331
<i>Eliminate all obstructions.</i>

839
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,422
Eliminate all obstructions!

840
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,351
Over here! Quick!

841
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:37,314
What are you two doing?
Leave if you're not members...

842
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:39,399
- Quiet!
- This is the wrong place.

843
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,818
No, it's right. There's a monster here.

844
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,069
Where?

845
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:44,154
There.

846
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,656
Weapons.

847
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,537
Step aside!

848
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,549
You scoundrel!

849
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,384
You monster!

850
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,272
Where did it go?

851
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,024
It ran away!

852
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,069
But why doesn't this stop?

853
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,488
Stop!

854
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,740
Oh my!

855
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:34,704
<i>Requesting a car to apprehend
two violent suspects. Please respond.</i>

856
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,873
Car Number 3, heading in.

857
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,461
- Who's the manager here?
- I am.

858
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,671
- Help me out.
- Yes.

859
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,089
Turn off the machines.

860
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,095
Come down now.

861
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,307
Put down the gun!

862
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,850
This guy has this too.

863
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,145
You know the Girl Who Shoots Thunder?

864
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,023
Put down the gun!

865
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,489
This feeling... I'm tingling...

866
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,810
Who are these people?

867
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:40,186
Who am I?

868
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,523
To learn that would take a lifetime.

869
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,026
And you?

870
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,240
Descendant of a noble family?
Strong pedigree, it seems.

871
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,953
How did you know that?

872
01:21:57,537 --> 01:21:58,872
I'm a sorcerer.

873
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,959
- Someone is coming.
- Who?

874
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,879
- Coming closer!
- Where?

875
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:08,840
There!

876
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,408
Mr. Blue!

877
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,493
Madam Black!

878
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,193
More thunder!

879
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,042
What's this place?

880
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,169
Run away!

881
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,388
Run!

882
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:39,514
I can't see!

883
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,520
Why is Sam-sik chasing after us?

884
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:46,688
He's chasing us!

885
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,314
You two? Why?

886
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:49,941
Because of the Divine Blade.

887
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:51,776
Where did you two come from?

888
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,945
We were running away
from a girl named Ean.

889
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:55,864
Ean?

890
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,369
By any chance,
is this the Ean you mentioned?

891
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,288
She looks similar.

892
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:05,123
This is really strange.

893
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:08,710
She's coming! That Ean bitch is coming!

894
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:10,295
Run!

895
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,340
Run away!

896
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,189
<i>Freight Train Number 270 departing.</i>

897
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,275
<i>Line workers, move aside.
The train is departing.</i>

898
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:33,443
What's this place?

899
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:04,641
Min-sun?

900
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:07,936
- Aunt, I'm at Ean's house now.
- Why are you there?

901
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:09,813
<i>She never showed up, so I came for her.</i>

902
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,732
<i>But something weird is behind the house.</i>

903
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,735
<i>And the man I saw on the news
is walking towards it.</i>

904
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,448
I think he saw me! Hold on...

905
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:21,574
Get out, quick!

906
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,452
No, I'll go there. Hide well, okay?

907
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:01,114
Muruk.

908
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,741
Muruk.

909
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:08,788
Muruk!

910
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,545
Who are you?

911
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,088
I'm a program!

912
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:20,049
Pro... then, Mr. Pro?

913
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,552
We spent ten years together.
Don't you recognize me?

914
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,137
I was Left Paw and Right Paw!

915
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,972
What are you talking about?

916
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:27,640
The girl?

917
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,351
Where did she go?

918
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:43,156
What is this?

919
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,285
Shall we start the attack program?

920
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,412
Start? Start what?

921
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,253
Don't just aim that anywhere!

922
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,509
Muruk! Get up!

923
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,932
That's right. Breathe in. Breathe out.

924
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,892
I was cut by the Blade.

925
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,021
Don't move. We'll need to go after them.

926
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:24,822
It's disappearing.

927
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,033
The energy is unstable.

928
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:32,080
That means there's still energy
remaining here.

929
01:27:34,248 --> 01:27:35,375
There it is.

930
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,504
Some energy still remains.

931
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,925
Okay.

932
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:47,178
Should we use this to go back?

933
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,644
I can see... Amazing...

934
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:56,646
Okay.

935
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:18,501
Ready to move. Muruk, shall we go?

936
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,962
- Where?
- Won't you save the girl?

937
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,798
The girl? She asked me to kill her.

938
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,718
Don't take what she says too literally.

939
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,262
Where are you two going?

940
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:32,473
To the future. 2022.

941
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:43,818
Here we go!

942
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,161
The future?

943
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:55,663
I'm seeing it again!

944
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:14,348
This is the future she spoke of?
The time to come?

945
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:16,726
Congratulations. You're in the future.

946
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,270
Taxi!

947
01:29:19,353 --> 01:29:20,521
Taxi?

948
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,023
What's a taxi?

949
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:24,317
Shout "taxi"
and they take you where you want.

950
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,943
Let's hurry.

951
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,070
Hold on!

952
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,030
Why does that thing keep following us?

953
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,407
Because the energy is unstable.

954
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:35,661
A link between here
and Big Rahn Inn remains.

955
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:36,871
But don't worry!

956
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,415
When we're done,
I'll take you back to your era.

957
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:42,835
14 minutes to the explosion. Shall we go?

958
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:52,428
Are you okay?

959
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:58,768
Customs Agent Min Gaelin! I need your car.

960
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,316
- Tasty!
- Let's go.

961
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,156
Look out!

962
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:19,413
Let's run!

963
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,461
Throw a charm!

964
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:28,548
A charm? Luckily, I have two charms left!

965
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:09,881
Let both of us die!

966
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:25,980
And the charms?

967
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,815
They died!

968
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:46,167
Wait, that train is headed
towards our house.

969
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:49,629
Are you ready, Muruk?

970
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:51,172
What? Sure.

971
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,507
Ready for what?

972
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,134
To stretch out your arm.

973
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:01,057
Right. You need to send that to Ean.

974
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,226
Send it? How?

975
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,394
Grab her hand.

976
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:07,688
Grab what?

977
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,696
Prisoner Number 8975.

978
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:17,740
Muruk?

979
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,744
Muruk! Come up here!

980
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:25,081
Yes, Mr. Pro! I'll be right up!

981
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:19,468
See you soon.

982
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:33,941
It's working!

983
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:46,579
Any weapons left?

984
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,622
No, I left them all behind!

985
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,386
- Catch!
- Mr. Blue!

986
01:34:04,388 --> 01:34:05,848
Run!

987
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,461
Don't you remember?
You wanted to save people with this.

988
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:36,545
Remember?

989
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,301
You told me. Whatever is inside you...

990
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,888
You are just you. It's okay.

991
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:56,649
What are you doing?

992
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:59,110
It's not mine.

993
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:02,029
I was just looking after it.

994
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,131
Begin extracting prisoner.

995
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:40,693
Help the Controller escape!

996
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,016
No!

997
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,311
It can't go inside me!

998
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,319
Six minutes to the explosion.

999
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:00,874
Okay. Now, connect to the energy
and stop the explosions.

1000
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,376
Get up, Ean.

1001
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:05,522
A weapon...

1002
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:47,690
Who is that?

1003
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,734
Nong-pa? What is he doing here?

1004
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,363
What is Nong-pa's saber doing here
in the future?

1005
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:00,744
It's getting up!

1006
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:20,055
Min-sun, I'm here! Hide yourself!

1007
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:24,143
What are you?

1008
01:40:24,226 --> 01:40:29,148
I am Nong-pa's descendant Min Gaelin.
Are you the owners of these weapons?

1009
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:33,444
<i>To my great descendants,
I pass along this message.</i>

1010
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:38,991
<i>The two sorcerers and Muruk have gone
to the future without weapons.</i>

1011
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:51,462
<i>In 2022, when the monsters appear,
present these weapons to them.</i>

1012
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:59,511
How can I be of help?

1013
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,722
We all must defeat that monster.

1014
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,516
What are you doing, <i>dosa</i> Muruk?

1015
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:09,021
<i>Dosa</i>? I'm just a hack.

1016
01:41:09,104 --> 01:41:10,898
Rise, my disciple!

1017
01:41:12,274 --> 01:41:16,862
Without that thing inside me, I'm nothing.

1018
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:25,954
The fan? I'm sure I left it behind.

1019
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:32,294
It's here.

1020
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:39,051
<i>Banyabaramil!</i>

1021
01:41:42,304 --> 01:41:43,430
<i>Banyabaramil!</i>

1022
01:42:01,573 --> 01:42:07,579
What's the point of spells?
It's all inside my mind.

1023
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:10,749
That's right, my disciple! Rise!

1024
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,417
He's my disciple!

1025
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:36,275
Marvelous Muruk is ready!

1026
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,883
Chances of winning this battle are 9%.

1027
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,384
10%.

1028
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:04,344
16%.

1029
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:08,849
Dad!

1030
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:14,271
Why is it going up? I'm at my end.

1031
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:19,318
I can see the future.

1032
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,446
Ean will solve this.

1033
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,283
Ean will solve this. With other humans.

1034
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:30,662
Humans can't solve this.
They don't have the strength.

1035
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:32,706
Not when they're alone.

1036
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,126
But now they are united.

1037
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,212
You're seeing that now?

1038
01:43:41,214 --> 01:43:46,345
I'm seeing it now.
I'll transmit it to you.

1039
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:11,620
Thunder!

1040
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:18,502
Plunge that into the spacecraft's heart.

1041
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,298
You're dead now!

1042
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,302
Let's go!

1043
01:45:50,802 --> 01:45:52,554
- You scoundrel!
- Die an early death!

1044
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:27,297
Look out, Ean!

1045
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:07,295
Run, Ean!

1046
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,386
<i>20 seconds to haava explosion.</i>

1047
01:47:15,428 --> 01:47:17,180
<i>Eliminate all obstacles!</i>

1048
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:29,192
Descendant of Nong-pa!
Throw the saber here!

1049
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:30,277
Lift me!

1050
01:48:31,129 --> 01:48:32,255
Thunder?

1051
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:34,549
Did we do it?

1052
01:48:58,615 --> 01:48:59,616
Aunt!

1053
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:02,410
Aunt!

1054
01:49:04,746 --> 01:49:05,747
Min-sun!

1055
01:49:14,005 --> 01:49:15,048
Aunt!

1056
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,137
Don't let it in your body!

1057
01:49:48,456 --> 01:49:49,958
Min-sun, are you okay?

1058
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:54,421
Who are you? Do you know me?

1059
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:08,893
The survivors...

1060
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:14,733
will keep escaping.

1061
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:28,455
What do we do now, Thunder?

1062
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,416
I need to take it outside.

1063
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:34,085
He'll come out again. We can't kill him.

1064
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,087
Can't stop him then.

1065
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:38,173
If you carry it outside,
and he comes out...

1066
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:42,177
Then we'll blow it up there.

1067
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,972
Then you'll die too.

1068
01:50:48,433 --> 01:50:50,101
I told you.

1069
01:50:50,852 --> 01:50:53,104
I need to carry those into space.

1070
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:56,816
That time has come.

1071
01:51:07,952 --> 01:51:10,080
It was Dad who told me that.

1072
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:17,379
Guard's program is right there.
With all his memories of you.

1073
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:26,679
Remember, Muruk? I mean, master?

1074
01:51:28,556 --> 01:51:29,641
Left Paw?

1075
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:32,018
Right Paw?

1076
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:36,106
Don't cry!

1077
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,275
Right Paw?

1078
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:42,362
You were alive?

1079
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:46,032
Sure. Did you see that?
I'm master's right hand.

1080
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,743
Only from the front.
I'm on the right side.

1081
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:53,331
Muruk, don't tell anyone
I saved the world.

1082
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:54,791
I'm too bashful.

1083
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,128
We must go back now, master.

1084
01:51:59,337 --> 01:52:00,338
Go where?

1085
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:04,175
Don't be sad. We're all pine trees
by the courtyard.

1086
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:08,805
Thanks for being by my side.

1087
01:52:09,639 --> 01:52:10,974
Thank you too.

1088
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:14,811
Go on back. That will disappear soon.

1089
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:22,444
Now, you should go back to your own time.

1090
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:31,953
Those cats were you?

1091
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:33,830
See you next time, Ean.

1092
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:38,751
Well then, catch you all later.

1093
01:52:40,378 --> 01:52:41,963
He smiled at me.

1094
01:52:42,046 --> 01:52:43,798
No, he was looking at me.

1095
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:23,565
You've done all you need to do?

1096
01:54:23,648 --> 01:54:24,983
Yes.

1097
01:54:26,734 --> 01:54:29,487
You got hurt so much because of me.

1098
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:30,947
No, I'm fine.

1099
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:51,634
Thank you, bridegroom.

1100
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:37,597
It's Big Rahn Inn!

1101
01:55:38,389 --> 01:55:40,350
We came back to the right place.

1102
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:45,021
I feel so proud and excited.
Why? Because we saved the world!

1103
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,191
- Muruk played a small part too.
- Right!

1104
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:50,735
Is Nong-pa still here? Did you see him?

1105
01:55:50,818 --> 01:55:52,904
- Are you really back from the future?
- Nong-pa!

1106
01:55:52,987 --> 01:55:54,572
We just saved the world.

1107
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:56,532
And met your descendant!

1108
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:57,617
But can you see us?

1109
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,701
I see very well!

1110
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:00,912
Come up and tell me all about it.

1111
01:56:00,995 --> 01:56:03,748
Of course, there's so much to tell.

1112
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,199
<i>What's this?</i>

1113
01:57:21,826 --> 01:57:22,910
<i>Hold on.</i>

1114
01:57:23,578 --> 01:57:26,289
<i>What did Mr. Pro say?</i>

1115
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:28,207
There it is.

1116
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:31,002
Some energy still remains.

1117
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:32,712
Hold on!

1118
01:57:32,795 --> 01:57:34,714
Why does that thing keep following us?

1119
01:57:34,797 --> 01:57:36,382
Because the energy is unstable.

1120
01:57:36,924 --> 01:57:39,927
A link between here
and Big Rahn Inn remains.

1121
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:54,734
There's still a link to Big Rahn Inn?

1122
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,119
It's open again.

1123
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:08,039
We need some alcohol.

1124
01:58:10,124 --> 01:58:11,793
Why don't you come up, Muruk?

1125
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,045
Pine tree by the courtyard...

1126
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:15,755
What?

1127
01:58:16,672 --> 01:58:19,675
I must go back.
There's something I forgot to say.

1128
01:58:51,999 --> 01:58:54,544
Taxi!
