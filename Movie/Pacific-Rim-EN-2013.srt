<i>When I was a kid,</i>

3
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:46,973
<i>whenever I'd feel small or lonely,
I'd look up at the stars.</i>

4
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:51,032
<i>Wondered if there was life
up there.</i>

5
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,433
<i>Turns out I was looking
in the wrong direction.</i>

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,467
<i>When alien life
entered our world</i>

7
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:59,302
<i>it was from deep beneath
the pacific ocean.</i>

8
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,144
<i>A fissure between
two tectonic plates.</i>

9
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:07,145
<i>A portal between dimensions.</i>

10
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,784
<i>The breach.</i>

11
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,985
<i>I was fifteen
when the first Kaiju</i>

12
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,155
<i>made land in San Francisco.</i>

13
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,816
<i>By the time tanks, jets
and missiles took it down</i>

14
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:49,824
<i>six days and 35 Miles later,
three cities were destroyed.</i>

15
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:53,155
<i>Tens of thousands
of lives were lost.</i>

16
00:01:57,398 --> 00:02:01,236
<i>We mourned our dead,
memorialized the attack,</i>

17
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,604
<i>and moved on.</i>

18
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:10,573
<i>And then, only six months later,</i>

19
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,982
<i>the second attack hit Manila.</i>

20
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:15,943
<i>The acid
factor of the Kaiju blood</i>

21
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:18,751
<i>creates a toxic phenomenon
named Kaiju Blue.</i>

22
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,284
<i>And then the third one hit Cabo.</i>

23
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,258
<i>And then the fourth.</i>

24
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,794
<i>And then we learned
this was not gonna stop.</i>

25
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,963
<i>This was just the beginning.</i>

26
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:32,199
<i>We needed a new weapon.</i>

27
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,431
<i>The world came together,
pooling its resources</i>

28
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:37,837
<i>and throwing aside old rivalries</i>

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,842
<i>for the sake
of the greater good.</i>

30
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:45,843
<i>To fight monsters,
we created monsters of our own.</i>

31
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:50,185
<i>The Jaeger program was born.</i>

32
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:52,616
<i>There were setbacks at first.</i>

33
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,251
<i>The neural load to interface
with a Jaeger</i>

34
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,957
<i>proved too much
for a single pilot.</i>

35
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,191
<i>A two-pilot system
was implemented.</i>

36
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:04,866
<i>Left-hemisphere,
right-hemisphere pilot control.</i>

37
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,297
<i>We started winning.</i>

38
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:10,632
<i>Jaegers stopping Kaijus
everywhere.</i>

39
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,079
<i>But the Jaegers were only
as good as their pilots.</i>

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,005
<i>So Jaeger pilots
turned into rock stars.</i>

41
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:20,472
<i>Danger turned into propaganda.</i>

42
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,242
<i>Kaijus into toys.</i>

43
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:27,185
<i>We got really good at it.</i>

44
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,789
<i>Winning.</i>

45
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:34,696
<i>Then...</i>

46
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,027
<i>Then it all changed.</i>

47
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,931
<i>Gipsy danger,
report to bay 08, level a-42.</i>

48
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:45,937
<i>Kaiju, Codename: Knifehead.
Category 3.</i>

49
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,601
Yo, Yancy, wake up!
Movement in the breach.

50
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,012
Hey, come on!
We're being deployed.

51
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,243
Great.
Good morning.

52
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,683
Mornin'.

53
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,284
Kaiju's a category 3...
biggest one yet.

54
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,822
Codename, Knifehead.

55
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:03,523
What time is it?

56
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,155
2:00

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,562
- A.M.?
- Yep.

58
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,393
What do you say?

59
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,468
Fifth notch on the belt?

60
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:16,068
<i>Come on, Beckets.
Time for the drop.</i>

61
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:19,231
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?

62
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,241
Don't get cocky.

63
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,644
<i>Years before,</i>

64
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:27,386
<i>you wouldn't have picked my
brother Yancy and I for heroes.</i>

65
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:28,413
<i>No chance.</i>

66
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:29,786
Good morning, sir.

67
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:31,985
All right, let's suit up
and kick some ass!

68
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,123
<i>We were never star athletes.</i>

69
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,554
<i>Never at the head of the class.</i>

70
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,662
<i>But we could hold our own
in a fight.</i>

71
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,493
<i>And it turned out
we had a unique skill,</i>

72
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,333
<i>we were drift compatible.</i>

73
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,715
All right.

74
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,716
<i>Data on helmet.</i>

<i>Good morning, Becket boys!</i>

77
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,019
Tendo, what's happening,
my man?

78
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,652
How'd that date with Alison
go <i>last night, Mr. Choi?</i>

79
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,896
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.

80
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,993
You're gonna get
your ass kicked.

81
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:49,625
<i>A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, brother.</i>

82
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,991
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.

83
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,799
Engaging drop, sir.

84
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,161
Marshal Pentecost on deck.

- Here we go.
- <i>Yeah!</i>

00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,655
<i>Here we go!</i>

91
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,562
Coupling confirmed, sir.

92

96
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,344
Rangers, this is Marshal Stacker Pentecost.
Prepare for neural handshake.

97
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,789
Starting in 15 seconds.

<i>with the body

108

<i>The deeper the bond...</i>

109
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:52,281
<i>The better you fight.</i>

110

<i>Gentlemen, your orders are</i>

to hold the miracle mile
off Anchorage. Copy?

116
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:20,815
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

117
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,046
Sir, there's still a civilian
vessel in the Gulf...

118
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,282
<i>Gentlemen,</i> you're protecting
a city of 2 million people.

119
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,727
You will not risk those lives
for a boat that holds 10.

120
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:28,583
<i>Am I clear?</i>

121
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,191
- Yes, sir.
- Man, that's cold.

122
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,893
You know what I'm thinking.

123
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,364
I'm in your brain.

124
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,595
- <i>I know.</i>
- Then let's go fishing.

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,234
Here we go!

00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,903
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!

127
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,974
Worry about yourself, kiddo!

<i>There are things

<i>You see a hurricane coming,

<i>But when you're in a Jaeger,</i>

131

<i>suddenly, you can fight
the hurricane.</i>

<i>You can win.</i>

133

Now!

00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,743
How far to the mainland?

136
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,174
7 Miles off Anchorage, sir.

137
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,179
But we won't even make it past
the shallows!

138
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,581
No, we won't!

139
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,213
What about that island
3 Miles east?

140
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,619
No! No!
It's 2 Miles, sir.

141
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:34,881
One mile, sir!

142
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,524
It's getting closer.

143
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,525
How the hell
can it be getting closer?

144
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,569
Kaiju.

145

<i>Harder starboard!</i>

Oh, God!

149
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,502
What the hell?

150
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,589

<i>Torque locked.</i>

154
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:28,808
Get him. Come on.
Shoot him.

155
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,534
I'm on it!
I'm on it!

156

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
Gipsy,
<i>what the hell is going on?</i>

160
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,954
Job's done, sir.
Lit it up twice.

161
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,457
Bagged our fifth kill.

162
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,195
- You disobeyed a direct order!
- <i>Respectfully, sir,</i>

163
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,827
we intercepted a Kaiju and
saved everyone on that boat.

164
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,731
Get back to your post, now!

165
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,336
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,837
Kaiju signature rising!

167
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,173
<i>Sensor checks.</i>

168
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:09,174
- That thing's still alive, sir.
- Gipsy!

169
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,512
<i>We're still getting
a signature!</i>

170
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:14,973
<i>That Kaiju is still alive!</i>

171
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,682
<i>Grab the boat
and get out of there.</i>

172
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,285
<i>You copy?</i>

173
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:22,687
<i>Grab the boat
and get out of there now!</i>

174
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:32,934
- Take it, Raleigh!
- I got this!

175
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,277
Loccent, we're hit!

176
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,514
Left arm's gone cold, sir.

177
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:10,634
The hull!
It went through the hull!

178
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,409
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need...

179
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,513
No! No!

180
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,847
<i>Loading.</i>

181
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,364
Second discharge fried
all the comms, sir.

182
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,309
I'm not getting any signals.

183
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,703
<i>Pressure dropping!</i>

184
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,706
<i>No pressure!
No pressure!</i>

185
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,608
No signatures, sir.

186
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,120
What do we do now, sir?

187
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:32,913
Now, I want you to keep
your eye on that gauge there.

188
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,751
Now, you know
what I'd like to find?

189
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,487
I'd like to find a whole ship.

190
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,122
That's what I'd like to find.

191
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:40,227
Wait, wait!

192
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,666
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

193
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,363
Wait!
Right there, right there!

194
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,564
Dig!

195
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,966
Hey, what is it?

196
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,704
It's just an old toy.

197
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:53,774
We never find anything good.

198
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:57,175
Listen.

199
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:00,143
Jeez!

200
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:07,682
Oh, my God.

201
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,779
Stay here!

202
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,036
<i>Mister?</i>

203
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,336
<i>Can I help?</i>

204
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,315
Yancy.

205
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,386
Yancy.

206
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:20,251
Run!
Get help, fast!

207
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,730
It's gonna be all right.

208
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,473
<i>The Kaiju are learning
our defenses.</i>

209
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,312
<i>They're adapting.
Evolving.</i>

210
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:15,213
<i>And we're losing Jaegers faster
than we can build them.</i>

211
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,846
<i>Lima.</i>

212
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,782
<i>Seattle.</i>

213
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,387
<i>Vladivostok.</i>

214
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,828
<i>Category 4 Kaijus are now
coming through the breach.</i>

215
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,826
<i>I think even you can see,
Marshal,</i>

216
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,228
<i>this is no longer
a sound strategy.</i>

217
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,537
<i>The frequency of the attacks
has increased.</i>

218
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:34,163
<i>The Jaegers are not
the most viable</i>

219
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:36,038
<i>line of defense anymore.</i>

220
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,839
I am aware.

221
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:41,572
Those are my rangers that die
every time a Jaeger falls,

222
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,680
- which is why I'm asking you for one...
<i>- Excuse me, Marshal</i>

223
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,890
- ...last chance...
- <i>Excuse me!</i>

224
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,250
- ...one final assault with everything we've got.
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

225
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,266
<i>The Jaeger program
is dead, Marshal.</i>

226
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,851
<i>On the other hand,</i>

227
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,853
<i>the coastal wall program
is a promising option.</i>

228
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,257
<i>The world appreciates all that
you and your men have done,</i>

229
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:58,428
<i>but it's over.</i>

230
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:01,357
<i>We will authorize you to
take all remaining Jaegers</i>

231
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,622
<i>to the last battle station,
Hong Kong.</i>

232
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:07,031
<i>We're prepared to fund you
for the next eight months</i>

233
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:08,805
<i>while the coastal wall
is completed.</i>

234
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,904
<i>After that, you will receive
no further support.</i>

235
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:15,336
<i>You have your answer, Marshal.</i>

236
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,502
So that's it?

237
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,312
It's over?

238
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,386
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.

239
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,415
That's all they are, Stacker.

240
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,893
We don't need 'em.

241
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:55,181
<i>Ration cards, guys!</i>

242
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,913
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

243
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,918
Let's go!

244
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,127
Now, I got good news
and I got bad news, fellas.

245
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:03,953
Which one you wanna hear first?

246
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,158
Bad news!

247
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,360
Bad news:

248
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:10,262
Three guys died yesterday
working the top of the wall.

249
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,466
<i>What's the good news?</i>

250
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:17,209
The good news is,
I got three new job openings.

251
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,305
Top of the wall.

252
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,176
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?

253
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,677
<i>Come on!</i>

254
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:08,285
<i>I am here in Sydney,
where earlier today,</i>

255
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,189
<i>yet another Kaiju attack
took place.</i>

256
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,952
<i>The Kaiju,
an enormous category 4,</i>

257
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:17,961
<i>broke through the coastal wall
in less than an hour.</i>

258
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:24,667
<i>The wall of life had been deemed
unbreachable by its builders.</i>

259
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,871
Why the hell are we even
buildin' this thing?

260
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:29,642
That... that thing

261
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,944
- went through the wall like it was nothing.
- <i>Ironically, it was</i>

262
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,376
<i>the recently decommissioned
Jaeger, Striker Eureka,</i>

263
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,382
<i>piloted by Herc
and Chuck Hansen,</i>

264
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:39,253
<i>that finally took
the beast down.</i>

265
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,776
<i>Look, they decommissioned</i>

266
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,818
<i>the Jaeger program
because of mediocre pilots.</i>

267
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,543
<i>It's that simple.</i>

268
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:09,618
<i>That's Striker Eureka's
tenth kill to date.</i>

269
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,347
<i>It's a new record.</i>

270
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,282
<i>And you're still
going to Hong Kong,</i>

271
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,955
<i>even at a time like this?</i>

272
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:17,256
<i>Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?</i>

273
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,558
<i>Come on, mate.</i>

274
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,592
<i>Chuck Hansen, one of
the pilots of Striker Eureka,</i>

275
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,570
<i>the Jaeger that took down
the Kaiju.</i>

276
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:38,912
Mr. Becket.

277
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:41,743
Marshal.
Looking sharp.

278
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:43,749
Long time.

279
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,911
Five years, four months.

280
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,688
Can I have a word?

281
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,289
<i>Attention,
all zone three welders.</i>

282
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,921
Step into my office, Marshal.

283
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,527
Took me a while to find you.

284
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,529
Anchorage, Sheldon point,
Nome...

285
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,931
Yeah, a man in my position
travels with the wall,

286
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:02,164
chasing shifts
to make a livin'.

287
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,237
What do you want?

288
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:07,138
I've spent the last six months

289
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:10,541
activating everything
I can get my hands on.

290
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:14,014
There's an old Jaeger,
a Mark 3.

291
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,445
You may know it.
It needs a pilot.

292
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,551
I'm guessing I wasn't
your first choice.

293
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:21,183
You are my first choice.

294
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:24,689
All the other Mark 3
pilots are dead.

295
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,566
Look...

296
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,167
I can't have anyone else
in my head again.

297
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,206
I'm done.

298
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:42,407
I was still connected
to my brother when he died.

299
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,046
I can't go through that again,
man, I'm sorry.

300
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,317
Haven't you heard,
Mr. Becket?

301
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,052
The world is coming to an end.

302
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:56,053
So where would you rather die?!

303
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:59,257
Here, or in a Jaeger?!

304
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,797
Mr. Becket,
this is Mako Mori.

305
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:12,398
One of our brightest.

306
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,969
Also in charge of the Mark 3
restoration program.

307
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,606
She personally handpicked
your copilot candidates.

308
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:25,945
Hey.

309
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,855
At ease.

310
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,092
We will tour the facility first

311
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:46,133
and then Miss Mori will show you
to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.

312
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,834
- Wait for us, please!
- Hold the door, please!

313
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,006
Thank you. Thank you.

314
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,610
Stay back! Kaiju specimens
are extremely rare,

315
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,878
so look
but don't touch, please.

316
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:59,217
Mr. Becket,
this is our research team.

317
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:01,073
Dr. Gottlieb
and Dr. Geiszler.

318
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,482
Oh, no, call me Newt.

319
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,784
Only my mother calls me doctor.

320
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:08,054
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello?

321
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:10,655
I have asked you not to refer to
me by my first name around others.

322
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,525
- I am a doctor with over 10 years...
- I know...

323
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:13,896
10 years of experience, man.

324
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,124
I'm very sorry.

325
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,698
Oh, please.
Who is that, Yamarashi?

326
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:21,599
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.

327
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,162
My brother and I
took him down in 2017.

328
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,732
You know he was one of
the biggest category 3s ever?

329
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:29,301
He was 2,500 tons of awesome.

330
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,743
- Or awful. You know, whatever you wanna call it.
- Yes, please excuse him.

331
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,481
He's a Kaiju groupie.
He loves...

332
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:40,486
Shut up, Hermann,
I don't love them, okay?

333
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:41,555
I study them.

334
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,323
And unlike most people,

335
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:45,524
I wanna see one alive
and up close one day.

336
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,897
Trust me, you don't want to.

337
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:53,898
So that's your
research division?

338
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,861
Things have changed.

339
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:01,675
We're not an army anymore,
Mr. Becket.

340
00:26:01,756 --> 00:26:03,789
We're the resistance.

341
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,792
Welcome to the Shatterdome.

342
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,779
War clock.

343
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,981
We reset it
after every Kaiju attack.

344
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:30,316
Keeps everyone focused.

345
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:32,685
The frequency of attacks
is accelerating.

346
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,520
How long till the next reset?

347
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,922
A week, if we're lucky.

348
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:39,024
My experts believe there'll
be a Kaiju attack

349
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,161
even before that.

350
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:42,896
This complex used to
lodge 30 Jaegers

351
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,165
in five bays
just like this one.

352
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,335
Now we only have
four Jaegers left.

353
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,304
I didn't know it was this bad.

354
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:53,839
It is that bad.

355
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,941
Crimson typhoon, China.

356
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:57,309
One of the greatest.

357
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,910
Assembled in Changzhou.

358
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:01,079
Full titanium core, no alloys.

359
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,849
Fifty diesel engines
per muscle strand.

360
00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:05,384
Deadly, precise fighter.

361
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,552
She's piloted by the
Wei Tang brothers.

362
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:08,821
Triplets.

363
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:10,523
Local lads.

364
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,076
They've successfully defended

365
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,626
Hong Kong port seven times.

366
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:15,628
They use
the thundercloud formation.

367
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,596
Oh, yeah.
Triple-arm technique.

368
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:18,931
Very effective.

369
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,204
That tank,
last of the T-90s.

370
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,440
Cherno Alpha.
First generation Mark 1.

371
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,076
The heaviest and oldest Jaeger
in the service.

372
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:34,313
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket,
it's a brutal war machine.

373
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:35,814
And those two,

374
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:37,383
Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovksy.

375
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:38,817
Yeah, I've heard of 'em.

376
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,853
Perimeter patrol,
Siberian wall.

377
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,889
On their watch it stayed
unbreached for six years.

378
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,259
Six years.

379
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:03,275
Herc! Chuck!

380
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:06,211
Gentlemen,
welcome to Hong Kong!

381
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,480
Wait here.

382
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:10,515
Max!
Come here!

383
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:11,184
Remember me?

384
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:13,386
Don't drool all over Miss Mori.

385
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:15,655
Sees a pretty girl
and he gets all wound up.

386
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:17,790
Raleigh,
this is Hercules Hansen,

387
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,458
An old friend
from the Mark 1 glory days.

388
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,193
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.

389
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:23,562
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.

390
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,764
- It was a three Jaeger team drop.
- That's right. Manila.

391
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,099
Sorry about your brother.

392
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:29,367
Thank you, sir.

393
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,304
Herc and his son Chuck
will be runnin' point.

394
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:32,639
Usin' Striker Eureka.

395
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,374
Fastest Jaeger in the world.

396
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:36,442
First and last of the Mark 5s.

397
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,014
Australia decommissioned it a

398
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,478
day before the Sydney attack.

399
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,880
- Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
- Yep.

400
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,082
Now it's runnin' point for us.

401
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,483
Wait, running point on what?

402
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,252
You haven't told me
what I'm doing here yet.

403
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:50,322
We're going for the breach,
Mr. Becket.

404
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:51,757
We're gonna strap a 2,400 pound

405
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,827
thermonuclear warhead
to Striker's back.

406
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:57,963
Detonate an equivalent of
1.2 million tons of TNT,

407
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:01,133
and you and two other Jaegers'll
be runnin' defense for them.

408
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,701
Thought we were the resistance.

409
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,236
Where'd you get something
that big?

410
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,405
See the Russians back there?

411
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,140
They can get us anything.

412
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:09,141
Herc, shall we?

413
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:10,509
Good to have you back.

414
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:11,744
Thank you, sir.

415
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:13,679
I'll show you
to your Jaeger now.

416
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,315
Miss Mori,
will you give me a minute?

417
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:19,651
Marshal!

418
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,753
Sir, we've hit
the breach before.

419
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:24,122
It doesn't work.
Nothing goes through.

420
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:25,423
What's changed?

421
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:28,026
I've got a plan.
I need you ready.

422
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:29,361
That's all.

423
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:31,396
Let's go, Herc!

424
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:33,365
Max, come here!

425
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:39,170
<i>Crew 17, please report
to the fifth floor.</i>

426
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:40,873
Zero minus two.

427
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,808
XY minus two.

428
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,176
R-E-Q.

429
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,077
In the beginning,

430
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,046
The Kaiju attacks
were spaced by 24 weeks.

431
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:50,049
Then twelve, then six,
then every two weeks.

432
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:54,118
The last one in Sydney
was a week.

433
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,055
In four days, we could be seeing
a Kaiju every eight hours

434
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,125
until they are coming
every four minutes.

435
00:29:59,127 --> 00:30:01,161
Marshal, we should witness
a double event

436
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:02,762
within seven days.

437
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:04,430
Mr. Gottlieb,

438
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:07,332
I'm to drop a 2,400 pound
thermonuclear bomb.

439
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:09,434
I need more than a prediction.

440
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,903
Well, uh,
that's a problem, then.

441
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:13,204
Because see, he actually

442
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:14,773
can't give you anything more
than a prediction.

443
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,909
No Kaiju entrails over my side
of the room.

444
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,010
You know the rules.

445
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:20,212
- Every bloody day it's incessant.
- Gents!

446
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:22,047
On point.

447
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,515
Numbers do not lie.

448
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:26,718
Politics and poetry,
promises, these are lies.

449
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,766
Numbers are as close as we get

450
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,488
to the handwriting of God.

451
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,223
What?

452
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,925
Would you give me a moment?

453
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,726
There will be a double event.

454
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:36,728
And then,
shortly thereafter, three.

455
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,763
And then four.

456
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:39,398
And then we're dead.

457
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
- I get it.
- Alas.

458
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:44,403
This is where
the good news comes.

459
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:50,007
Here is our universe,

460
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:52,677
and here is theirs.

461
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,946
And this is what we call
"the throat,"

462
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:55,648
the passage between
the breach and us.

463
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,550
We know that it's atomic
in nature.

464
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,952
I predict that
the increased traffic

465
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:02,754
will force the breach
to stabilize

466
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:04,589
and remain open long enough

467
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,526
to get the device through...

468
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:09,862
and collapse its structure.

469
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:12,330
Yeah, and that's where
I gotta chime in,

470
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,699
because, really,
I wouldn't wanna go in there

471
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,435
with that limited amount
of information.

472
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,660
- Newton, don't embarrass yourself.
- I was tryin' to say.

473
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,040
Just hear me out for a second.
Give me a second, please.

474
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,083
Why do we judge the Kaiju
on a category system?

475
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,779
It's because each one is completely
different from the next, right?

476
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:28,381
You see what I'm saying?
One looks like

477
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,281
a shark and one
looks like a fish...

478
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:31,450
Dr. Geiszler.
Just get to the point.

479
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,385
- Yes.
- The point is I don't think

480
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,120
they're all completely different
after all.

481
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:37,189
These are some samples
I collected, all right?

482
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:40,392
Now, this one here
was harvested in Sydney.

483
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:42,994
And this was harvested
in Manila,

484
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,429
6 years ago.

485
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:48,266
They have the same exact DNA.

486
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:50,503
They're clones.

487
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,907
And this is the point where
he goes completely crazy.

488
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,710
There's so much more to
the Kaiju than we understand.

489
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,446
And we've really only
scratched the surface.

490
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:02,748
This is a piece
of a Kaiju's brain.

491
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,917
Now, unfortunately,
it's damaged.

492
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,720
It's a little bit weak.
But it's still alive.

493
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:09,288
Now, I think I can tap into it.

494
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,923
Using the same technology

495
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:13,525
that allows the two Jaeger
pilots to share a neural bridge.

496
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:15,660
Now, think about that.

497
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:17,496
I could tell you exactly

498
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,164
how to get through
the breach yourselves.

499
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,767
You're suggesting that we
initiate a drift with a Kaiju?

500
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:24,336
No, no. No, no. Not like
a whole Kaiju, you know,

501
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:25,804
just a tiny piece of its brain.

502
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,373
The neural surge would be
too much for the human brain.

503
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,842
- I agree.
- I don't agree.

504
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:34,845
Gottlieb, I'd like your data
on my desk asap.

505
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:35,280
Sir.

506
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:37,682
- No, but his is so...
- Thank you, Newt.

507
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,985
Guys, now, this is
the most amazing thing...

508
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:42,154
Newton, I know that you're
desperate to be right.

509
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:44,857
So you've not wasted your life
being a Kaiju groupie,

510
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,458
but it's not going to work.

511
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,993
It is going to work, Hermann.

512
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,695
And I'll tell you
something else.

513
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,296
Fortune favors the brave, dude.

514
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:52,597
You heard them.

515
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,732
They won't give you
the equipment

516
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:56,801
and even if they did,
you'd kill yourself.

517
00:32:57,303 --> 00:33:00,372
Well, I'd be a rock star.

518
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,743
There she is.

519
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:10,215
Oh, my God.

520
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,151
Look at her.

521
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:18,123
Gipsy danger.

522
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,925
God, it's so beautiful.

523
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,360
She looks like new.

524
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:23,828
Better than new.

525
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,464
She has a double-core
nuclear reactor.

526
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:29,968
She's one of a kind now.

527
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,370
She always was.

528
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,839
How do you like
your ride, Becket boy?

529
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:36,474
Solid iron hull, no alloys.

530
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:38,677
Forty engine blocks
per muscle strands.

531
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,612
Hyper-torque driver
for every limb

532
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:42,447
and a new fluid synapse system.

533
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,383
Come here.

534
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:45,584
Tendo.

535
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,586
It's good to see you, buddy.

536
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:49,755
It's good
to see you too, brother.

537
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,290
It's just like old times.

538
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,660
So what's your story?

539
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:57,595
Restoring old Jaegers,

540
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:00,031
showing has-beens
like me around.

541
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,566
That cannot be it.

542
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:02,935
You a pilot?

543
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:04,970
No. Not yet.

544
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:08,840
But I wanna be one,
more than anything.

545
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,375
What's your simulator score?

546
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:13,579
51 drops, 51 kills.

547
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,947
Wow, that's amazing.

548
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:18,116
But you're not one of
the candidates tomorrow?

549
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,284
I am not.

550
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:22,887
The marshal has his reasons.

551
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,622
Yeah, he always does,
doesn't he?

552
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:27,992
But with 51 kills, I can't
imagine what they could be.

553
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,695
I hope you approve
of my choices.

554
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:35,600
I've studied your fighting
techniques and strategy.

555
00:34:35,602 --> 00:34:38,002
Even... Alaska.

556
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:41,072
And what do you think?

557
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:45,743
I think you're unpredictable.

558
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:47,245
You have a habit of deviating

559
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,448
from standard
combat techniques.

560
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,751
You take risks and injure
yourself and your crew.

561
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:57,021
I don't think you're the right
man for this mission.

562
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,259
Wow.

563
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:03,261
Thank you for your honesty.

564
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,830
You might be right.

565
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,999
But one day,
when you're a pilot,

566
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:12,237
you're gonna see that in combat,
you make decisions.

567
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,776
And you have to live
with the consequences.

568
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:22,413
That's what I'm trying to do.

569
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,114
The candidates are ready.

570
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,283
We will commence the trials
immediately, sir.

571
00:35:58,285 --> 00:35:59,651
- Good.
- But there is one thing.

572
00:35:59,653 --> 00:36:02,520
Mako,
we have talked about this.

573
00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:05,123
We will not be talking
about it again.

574
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,826
- Hm?
- You promised me.

575
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:13,531
Mako.

576
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:17,569
Vengeance is like
an open wound.

577
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:21,439
You cannot take that level
of emotion into the drift.

578
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,409
For my family, I need...

579
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:38,256
Raleigh.

580
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,590
Come sit with us.

581
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,359
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

582
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:44,862
Ah, come on, there's plenty
of room at our table.

583
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:46,530
I haven't seen bread in awhile.

584
00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:47,599
Hong Kong.

585
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:49,734
Beauty of an open port,
no rationing.

586
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:53,972
We've got potatoes, peas, sweet
beans, decent meat loaf.

587
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:55,640
Pass the potatoes.

588
00:36:56,242 --> 00:36:59,711
Raleigh, this is my son, Chuck.
He's my copilot now.

589
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:02,280
He's more my copilot,
right, dad?

590
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:04,716
So you're the guy, eh?

591
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:06,351
You're the guy who's gonna run
defense for me

592
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,952
in that old rust bucket
of yours?

593
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,222
- That's the plan.
- Good.

594
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:12,657
So when was the last time
you jockeyed, Ray?

595
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:16,061
About five years ago.

596
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:17,896
What have you been doin'
for five years?

597
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,631
Something pretty important,
I reckon.

598
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:24,269
- I was in construction.
- Oh, wow, that's great.

599
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:25,570
That's really useful.

600
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:27,005
Uh, you know,
we get into a fight,

601
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:28,740
You can build our way
out of it, eh, Ray?

602
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:32,543
It's Raleigh.

603
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:34,312
Whatever.

604
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:37,281
Look, you're Pentecost's
bright idea.

605
00:37:37,283 --> 00:37:38,583
My old man,
he seems to like you,

606
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:40,059
but it's guys like you who

607
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,987
brought down the Jaeger program.

608
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,456
To me, you're dead weight.
You slow me down,

609
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:47,091
I'm gonna drop you
like a sack of Kaiju shit.

610
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,796
I'll see you around, Raleigh.

611
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:52,064
Come, Max.

612
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,300
You can blame me for that one.

613
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:56,801
I've raised him on my own.

614
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:58,637
He's a smart kid,
but I never knew

615
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,374
whether to give him a hug
or a kick in the ass.

616
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:05,209
With respect, sir...

617
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:08,747
I'm pretty sure
which one he needs.

618
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:18,389
4 points to zero.

619
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,635
4 points to 1.

620
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,219
4 points to 2.

621
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:49,887
Okay, what?

622
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,455
You don't like 'em?

623
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:53,691
I thought you selected
them personally.

624
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:55,860
- Excuse me?
- Every time a match ends

625
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,396
you make this little gesture,

626
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,865
Like you're critical
of their performance.

627
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,268
It's not their performance,
it's yours.

628
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,070
Your gambit.

629
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:07,038
You could have taken all
of them two moves earlier.

630
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,141
- You think so?
- I know so.

631
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:12,076
Can we change this up?

632
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:15,379
How 'bout we give her a shot?

633
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:17,415
No.

634
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,684
We stick to the cadet list
we have, ranger.

635
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:21,853
Only candidates
with drift compatibility...

636
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,421
Which I have, Marshal.

637
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:25,090
Mako, this is not only about
a neural connection.

638
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:27,726
It's also about
a physical compatibility.

639
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:29,427
What's the matter, Marshal?

640
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:31,735
Don't think your brightest can
cut it in the ring with me?

641
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:36,401
Go.

642
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,141
Four strikes marks a win.

643
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,883
Remember,
it's about compatibility.

644
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:53,652
It's a dialogue, not a fight.

645
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,787
But I'm not gonna dial down
my moves.

646
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,422
Okay.

647
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:01,525
Then neither will I.

648
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,010
1-0.

649
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:22,514
1-1.

650
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,553
2-1.
Concentrate.

651
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:37,829
2-2.

652
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,263
Better watch it.

653
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,311
3-2.

654
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:54,612
Morisan.

655
00:41:18,136 --> 00:41:20,171
Enough.

656
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:23,174
I've seen what I need to see.

657
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,509
Me too.

658
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:26,077
She's my copilot.

659
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,980
That's not going to work.

660
00:41:28,982 --> 00:41:31,649
- Why not?
- Because I said so, Mr. Becket.

661
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:33,118
I made my decision.

662
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,753
Report to the shatterdome
in two hours.

663
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:36,821
And find out
who your copilot will be.

664
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,239
Mako.

665
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:56,374
What was all that about?

666
00:41:56,776 --> 00:42:00,178
I mean, I'm not crazy.
You felt it, right?

667
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,513
We are drift compatible.

668
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:03,415
Thank you for standing up
for me.

669
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:07,318
But there is nothing
to talk about.

670
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:14,291
That's my room.

671
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,395
Excuse me.

672
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:19,531
I mean, come on. I thought
you wanted to be a pilot.

673
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:24,503
Mako,
this is worth fighting for.

674
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:27,239
We don't have to just obey him.

675
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:33,711
It's not obedience,
Mr. Becket.

676
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:37,114
It's respect.

677
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:40,417
Would you at least tell me
what his problem is?

678
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:03,674
<i>In the wake
of the Sydney incident,</i>

679
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:05,577
<i>which showed

680

<i>of the wall of life program,</i>

681
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,714

the government's motives</i>

682
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:13,751
<i>and wondering why the Jaeger

683
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:15,987
<i>Riots have erupted

684

<i>Safe zones?
For the rich and powerful?</i>

688
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,301
<i>What about the rest of us?</i>

689
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,536
<i>Yeah, answer the question.</i>

690
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:33,304
<i>I believe the wall of life</i>

691

692
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,209
<i>And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter.</i>

693
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:38,810
<i>Than... Thank you.</i>

694
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:46,584
Kaiju-human drift
experiment, take one.

695
00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:51,155
The, uh... the brain
segment is the frontal lobe.

696
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:54,658
Um, chances are...

697
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,228
the segment's far too
damaged to drift with.

698
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,017
Unscientific aside.

699
00:43:59,298 --> 00:44:01,965
Hermann, if you're
listening to this,

700
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,300
Well, I'm either alive

701
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:06,336
and I've proven
what I've just done works...

702
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:07,939
in which case, ha, I won.

703
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:10,541
Or I'm dead and I'd like you to
know that it's all your fault.

704
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:12,210
It really is, you know.

705
00:44:12,212 --> 00:44:15,680
You drove me to this.
In which case, ha, I also won.

706
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:17,816
Sort of.

707
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:20,184
I'm going in in three...

708
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:23,287
two...

709
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:24,888
one.

710
00:44:25,023 --> 00:44:26,858
Hah!

711
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,448
Newton.
Newton!

712
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,784
What have you done?

713
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:02,928
<i>Gipsy danger neural test</i>

<i>Gipsy danger neural test

00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:28,652
Mm.
May I come in, Mako?

719
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:34,258
<i>All pilots report to mess hall.</i>

720
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,795
A long time ago,
I made you a promise.

721
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:48,973
These transmitters
are non-operative.

722
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:50,475
I need them replaced.

723
00:45:57,148 --> 00:45:58,783
Setting harness for test mode.

724
00:45:58,785 --> 00:46:00,384
Waiting for second pilot.

725
00:46:09,861 --> 00:46:11,428
<i>Two pilots on board.</i>

726
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,531
I'm gonna take this side
if you don't mind.

727
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:15,266
My left arm's kinda shot.

728
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:16,934
Sure.

729
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,605
Are you gonna say anything?

730
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,607
No point.

731
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:27,244
In five minutes you're
gonna be inside my head.

732
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:29,012
You look good.

733
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,952
<i>Pilots on board
and ready to connect.</i>

734
00:46:35,154 --> 00:46:36,887
Prepare for neural handshake.

735
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:39,423
Initiating neural handshake.

736
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,466
We're not in
the simulator now, Mako.

737
00:46:48,468 --> 00:46:50,869
Remember,
don't chase the rabbit.

738
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,537
Random access
brain impulse triggers.

739
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:53,771
Memories.

740
00:46:53,773 --> 00:46:55,839
Just let 'em flow,
don't latch on.

741
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,908
Tune 'em out.
Stay in the drift.

742
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,343
The drift is silence.

743
00:46:59,645 --> 00:47:03,914
<i>Neural interface drift

745
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:16,994
<i>Mama!</i>

00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:20,564
<i>Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!</i>

747
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:27,338
<i>Right hemisphere calibrated.</i>

748
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,141
<i>Left hemisphere calibrated.</i>

749
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,812
<i>Ready to activate the Jaeger.</i>

750
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:40,350
Okay, Gipsy.
Lining up nicely.

751
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:42,219
Better get ready.

752
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,221
<i>Pilot to Jaeger connection
complete.</i>

753
00:47:44,223 --> 00:47:46,057
Marshal!
Marshal!

754
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:47,291
I need to talk to you.

755
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:49,059
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.

756
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:49,994
I can appreciate

757
00:47:49,996 --> 00:47:51,395
how important
this moment is to me.

758
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:53,064
Newton created a neural bridge

759
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:55,466
from garbage
and drifted with a Kaiju.

760
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:02,974
I found him prone,
and he's sort of dazed.

761
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:06,076
I don't exactly know
what to do.

762
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,515
I told you it would work.

763
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:14,351
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?

764
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:15,853
You know, it was only
a fragment of a brain,

765
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:19,023
so really all I was able to get
was, like, a series

766
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,092
of, uh, images or...
impressions. You know?

767
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:23,427
Like when you blink your eyes
over and over and over again.

768
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:24,895
All you really see
are, like, frames.

769
00:48:24,897 --> 00:48:27,731
- Um, it was emotional in the...
- Newton, Newton. Okay, Newton.

770
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:30,968
- It was so...
- Newton, look at me.

771
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,373
Now I want you to take your time
and be very specific.

772
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,243
Okay.

773
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:40,744
Well, I don't feel like
they're just

774
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:42,313
following some
sort of animalistic urge,

775
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:43,847
you know, just hunting
and gathering.

776
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,950
And I think they're attacking us
under orders.

777
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,318
That's impossible.

778
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,220
- Is that impossible?
- It's impossible.

779
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,002
- Because...
- You know what?

780
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,920
Why don't you drift
with a Kaiju?!

781
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,823
You! Shut up!

782
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:53,991
Yes, sir.

783
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:56,660
You, keep talking.

784
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:03,967
These beings, these masters,
they're colonists.

785
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,535
They overtake worlds.
They just...

786
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:07,204
They just consume them
and then...

787
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:08,705
they move on to the next.

788
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:11,608
And they've been here before
in sort of a trial run.

789
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,676
It was the dinosaurs.

790
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:14,878
But the atmosphere
wasn't conducive, right?

791
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,448
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.

792
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,983
And now, you know,
with ozone depletion,

793
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,385
and carbon monoxide,
polluted waters...

794
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,787
Well, we've practically
terraformed it for them.

795
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:25,189
'Cause now they're coming back,
and it's perfect.

796
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:27,191
See, the first wave,
that was just the hounds.

797
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:28,960
Categories 1 through 4,
it was nothing.

798
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:30,795
Their sole purpose was to aim
for the populated areas

799
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:32,163
and take out the vermin, us!

800
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:34,566
The second wave,
that is the exterminators.

801
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:36,501
And they will finish the job.

802
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:40,539
And then, the new tenants
will take possession.

803
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:43,541
See, the reason that I found
the identical DNA

804
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:44,642
in the two separate Kaiju organs

805
00:49:44,652 --> 00:49:46,011
is because they are grown!

806
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:48,712
Newton,
I need you to do it again.

807
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,814
I need more information.

808
00:49:50,816 --> 00:49:53,817
Wh...? I can't...
I can't do it again.

809
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,053
I mean, not unless you have

810
00:49:55,055 --> 00:49:57,889
a fresh Kaiju brain
lying around.

811
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:02,525
Do you?

812
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,300
Pretty impressive.

813
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,136
Yeah, he remembers
how to turn it on.

814
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:13,638
Oi, show some respect.

815
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,039
When his brother died,

816
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,075
he got the Jaeger back to shore
on his own.

817
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:20,078
I've known one other pilot's
been able to do that.

818
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,513
Now, there are
certain individuals

819
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:23,315
whose business
is the preservation

820
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:25,083
and exploitation
of Kaiju remains.

821
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:27,818
Yeah, right, black market
dealers, right?

822
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,954
Yep. They're in and out
in a matter of hours.

823
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:31,856
They neutralize the acidic
factor of the blood,

824
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:33,858
and they harvest
what they need.

825
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,094
Now, this guy,
this is Hannibal Chau.

826
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:39,329
He runs the Kaiju black market
here in Asia.

827
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:40,631
When our funding ran out,

828
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,199
we turned to him for help,
and in return,

829
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,401
I gave him exclusive rights

830
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:44,935
to all Kaiju remains
in the region.

831
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:46,070
You did that?

832
00:50:46,072 --> 00:50:47,938
Last days of war, gentlemen.

833
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,441
Go to the corner of Fong
and Tull.

834
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:52,543
Show them that card.
Look for that symbol.

835
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:56,013
And a word to the wise,
do not trust him.

836
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:03,454
<i>Calibration complete.</i>

837
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:05,656
The hull!
It went through the hull!

838
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:07,558
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need...

839
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:11,962
<i>Pilot out of alignment.</i>

840
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,397
Both out of alignment.

841
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:14,765
Both of them?

842
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:17,234
Both of them.
Gipsy, Gipsy!

843
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:18,736
You're out of alignment!

844
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:21,438
- <i>You are both out of alignment</i>
- I'm okay. Just let me control it.

845
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:23,442
<i>You're stabilizing.
But Mako is way out.</i>

846
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,310
- Mako.
- <i>She's starting to chase the rabbit!</i>

847
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:28,879
Mako, don't get stuck
in a memory.

848
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,615
<i>Stay with me.
Stay in the now.</i>

849
00:51:31,617 --> 00:51:33,284
<i>Don't engage in a memory.</i>

850
00:51:34,186 --> 00:51:35,686
<i>Mako.</i>

851
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:37,020
<i>Mako!</i>

852
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:38,622
<i>Listen to me.</i>

853
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:40,424
<i>Mako?</i>

854
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:02,411
Mama!

855
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,000
Mama!

856
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:02,071
Mako.

857
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,641
This is just a memory.

858
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:06,510
None of this is real.

859
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:33,003
<i>Weapons system engaged.</i>

860
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,806
<i>Plasma cannon powering up.</i>

861
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:38,308
Oh, no.

862
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:51,989
Weapon system engaged!
Go to fail-safe!

863
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:52,957
Fail-safe not responding.

864
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:54,659
There's a problem
with the neural blocker!

865
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:57,361
Her connection's
way too strong!

866
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,230
- Fully charged.
- <i>Mako!</i>

867
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,765
Mako, listen to me.

868
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:05,302
This is just a memory.
None of it is real.

869
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,788
The power line!
The power line!

870
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,358
Get the main power line!

871
00:54:46,978 --> 00:54:49,713
Take them offline!
Take them offline!

872
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:53,650
I just did.

873
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:03,994
<i>Weapon system disengaged.</i>

874
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:07,597
Mako!

875
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:15,538
<i>Neural bridge exercise invalid.</i>

876
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:20,911
It's okay.
It's okay.

877
00:55:20,913 --> 00:55:24,114
<i>Drift sequence terminated.</i>

878
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:28,285
<i>Would you like to try again?</i>

879
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:00,717
Hello.

880
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:18,668
Pss psst.

881
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,405
You looking for
some Kaiju bone powder?

882
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:23,907
Some bone...?

883
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,309
Some bone powder?

884
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:28,411
Uh, no, why would I want that?

885
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:32,315
Male potency.
I take it myself.

886
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:35,318
I see.
Uh, no, thank you.

887
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,821
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

888
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,158
Come.

889
00:56:43,828 --> 00:56:46,163
Hannibal Chau, huh?

890
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:48,431
Good luck.

891
00:56:56,007 --> 00:56:57,974
Oh, my God!

892
00:56:57,976 --> 00:57:00,043
Oh, my God,
this place is heaven!

893
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:03,313
That's a lymph gland
from a category 2!

894
00:57:03,315 --> 00:57:04,481
And what are you
working on here?

895
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:07,150
Is this a cuticle?
In mint condition?

896
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:09,953
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?

897
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:11,588
I've never seen them
alive before!

898
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,124
They usually die
as soon as the Kaiju falls!

899
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:15,692
I thought you couldn't
keep them alive!

900
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:18,228
You can if you soak
'em in ammonia.

901
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:25,403
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

902
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:26,804
I was told he was here.

903
00:57:29,475 --> 00:57:30,941
Who wants to know?

904
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:35,144
I really can't say.

905
00:57:37,848 --> 00:57:39,382
Aah! Aah!

906
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:40,884
Stacker Pentecost sent me!

907
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:44,020
Aah! Aah!

908
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,223
Oh, that's great.
That's real great.

909
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:48,692
So I take it
you're Hannibal Chau, right?

910
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:49,960
You like the name?

911
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:51,328
I took it from, uh...

912
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,996
my favorite
historical character

913
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:55,332
and my second Favorite Szechuan
restaurant in Brooklyn.

914
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:57,300
Now tell me what you want,

915
00:57:57,302 --> 00:58:00,471
before I gut you like a pig
and feed you to the skin louse.

916
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:02,006
<i>She can't control her drift,</i>

917
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,608
<i>and he went out of phase first!</i>

918
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,843
<i>We all know what happened.</i>

919
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:07,146
<i>We can't afford mistakes,
the Kaiju keep evolving,</i>

920
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:08,714
<i>they keep kicking our asses!</i>

921
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:11,315
<i>He's a has-been,
she's a rookie.</i>

922
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:14,317
<i>I don't want them protecting
my bomb run, sir.</i>

923
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:19,923
You need to watch your tone,
Mr. Hansen.

924
00:58:19,925 --> 00:58:22,459
Hey, stay there.

925
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,195
Give me a moment.

926
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:30,066
You two are a goddamn disgrace.

927
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:33,954
You're gonna get us all killed,
and here's the thing, Raleigh,

928
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,273
I want to come back
from this mission

929
00:58:36,275 --> 00:58:39,143
'cause I quite like my life.

930
00:58:39,145 --> 00:58:42,646
So why don't you just do us all
a favor and disappear?

931
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:43,847
It's the only thing
you're good at.

932
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:45,749
Stop! Now!

933
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:47,818
Yeah, that's right.

934
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,853
You just hold back
your little girlfriend.

935
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:53,723
One of you bitches
needs a leash.

936
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:02,499
- Apologize to her.
- Screw you.

937
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,676
Aah!

938
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,146
Aah!

939
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:23,052
I said apologize to her.

940
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,961
Hey!
Hey! Enough!

941
00:59:30,963 --> 00:59:32,463
What's going on?

942
00:59:32,765 --> 00:59:34,831
On your feet, both of you!

943
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:42,506
Becket, Mori,
into my office, now.

944
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:44,107
- No, we aren't finished!
- Hey! Hey! This is over!

945
00:59:44,109 --> 00:59:45,610
You're a ranger, for Chrissake.

946
00:59:45,612 --> 00:59:47,044
Why don't you start
acting like one?

947
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:56,019
I went out of phase first.
It was my mistake.

948
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:58,154
No.

949
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:01,090
It was my mistake.

950
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,761
I should have never let you
two in the same machine.

951
01:00:04,763 --> 01:00:06,263
So, what?

952
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:07,664
You're grounding us?

953
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:09,199
Not you.

954
01:00:16,973 --> 01:00:20,910
Permission
to be dismissed, sir.

955
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:26,749
Permission granted, Miss Mori.

956
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:33,055
Mako.

957
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:36,127
Sir, what are you doing?

958
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:40,064
She is the strongest
candidate by far.

959
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:42,266
What other options do we have?

960
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:43,701
Huh? Tell me!

961
01:00:43,703 --> 01:00:48,005
Do not let my calm demeanor
fool you, ranger!

962
01:00:49,307 --> 01:00:53,709
Now is not a good moment
for your insubordination!

963
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:55,345
Mako is too inexperienced

964
01:00:55,347 --> 01:00:58,181
to reign in her memories
during combat.

965
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:03,153
That's not why
you grounded her.

966
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:06,923
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.

967
01:01:06,925 --> 01:01:09,259
I don't care
what you think you saw.

968
01:03:02,473 --> 01:03:04,640
I know what she means to you.

969
01:03:04,642 --> 01:03:06,242
I saw it! I...

970
01:03:06,244 --> 01:03:07,610
Hey! Hey!

971
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:09,546
This conversation is over.

972
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:11,552
Marshal. Marshal,
can we just talk

973
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:14,842
about this for one second?!

974
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:21,123
You rescued her.

975
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,792
You raised her.

976
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:25,061
You're not protecting her now.

977
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:26,897
You are holding her back.

978
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:30,902
One, don't you ever
touch me again.

979
01:03:30,928 --> 01:03:34,529
Two, don't you ever
touch me again.

980
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,042
Now, you have no idea
who the hell I am

981
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:41,177
or where I've come from,

982
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:43,947
and I'm not about to tell you
my whole life story.

983
01:03:44,249 --> 01:03:46,483
All I need to be to you
and everybody in this dome

984
01:03:46,485 --> 01:03:48,485
is a fixed point.

985
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:51,587
The last man standing.

986
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:54,691
I do not need your sympathy
or your admiration.

987
01:03:54,693 --> 01:03:58,962
All I need is your compliance
and your fighting skills.

988
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:01,264
And if I can't get that,

989
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:02,933
then you can go back
to the wall

990
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:05,502
that I found you crawling on.

991
01:04:05,504 --> 01:04:08,371
Do I make myself clear?

992
01:04:14,577 --> 01:04:17,812
Yes, sir.

993
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:19,849
Good.

994
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:49,745
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

995
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:52,449
<i>I should've warned you.</i>

996
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:54,484
First drifts are rough.

997
01:04:54,886 --> 01:04:57,087
But you weren't just tapping
into my memories.

998
01:04:57,089 --> 01:04:59,789
You were tapping
into my brother's too.

999
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:05,729
When Yancy was taken,
we were still connected.

1000
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:09,032
I felt his fear, his pain,

1001
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:12,835
his helplessness, and then...

1002
01:05:12,937 --> 01:05:14,604
he was gone.

1003
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:17,540
I felt it.
I know.

1004
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:22,645
You know, you live in someone
else's head for so long

1005
01:05:22,647 --> 01:05:25,281
the hardest part to deal with
is the silence.

1006
01:05:25,683 --> 01:05:29,452
To let someone else in,
to really connect,

1007
01:05:29,454 --> 01:05:32,455
you have to trust them.

1008
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:36,893
And today the drift was strong.

1009
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:45,067
Her heart.

1010
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:47,771
When's the last time
you saw it?

1011
01:05:47,773 --> 01:05:50,640
Not in a long time.

1012
01:05:56,312 --> 01:05:58,314
<i>Movement in the breach.</i>

1013
01:05:58,316 --> 01:05:59,916
<i>Double event.</i>

1014
01:06:02,986 --> 01:06:04,487
<i>Two signatures.</i>

1015
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:09,225
<i>Dilation indicator, category 4.</i>

1016
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:19,336
Excuse me.

1017
01:06:19,338 --> 01:06:21,638
The breach was
exposed at 2300 hours.

1018
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,040
We have two signatures,
both category 4s.

1019
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:26,176
Otachi and leatherback.

1020
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:27,777
They'll reach Hong Kong
within the hour.

1021
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:29,846
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.

1022
01:06:30,248 --> 01:06:32,815
I want every single civilian
in a refuge right now.

1023
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:34,984
Crimson typhoon, Cherno Alpha,

1024
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:36,786
I want you to frontline
the harbor.

1025
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:37,888
Stay on the miracle mile.

1026
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:39,690
Striker,
I want you to stay back,

1027
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:41,124
look after the coastline.

1028
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:42,726
We cannot afford to lose you,

1029
01:06:42,728 --> 01:06:44,928
so only engage
as a final option.

1030
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,262
Yes, sir!

1031
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:47,463
You two.

1032
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:49,833
You stay put.

1033
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:51,534
Let's go!

1034
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:11,654
Loccent, Striker's got the ball
and we're on the roll.

1035
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:16,793
Loccent... near positions
and awaiting your orders.

1036
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:20,196
<i>Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.</i>

1037
01:07:20,198 --> 01:07:21,798
<i>Guys, keep your eyes open.</i>

1038
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,867
<i>These category 4s are
the biggest we've ever seen,</i>

1039
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:25,235
<i>both in size and weight.</i>

1040
01:07:27,638 --> 01:07:29,372
<i>Cherno Alpha
reaching target zone.</i>

1041
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:31,107
Disengaging transport.

1042
01:07:50,994 --> 01:07:54,263
<i>Cherno Alpha in position.
Miracle mile.</i>

1043
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:56,900
Cherno Alpha
holding the coastline.

1044
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,234
<i>Beacon is on.</i>

1045
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,378
Look at 'em.

1046
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,814
They believe the Kaiju
are sent from heaven.

1047
01:08:10,816 --> 01:08:12,916
That the gods are expressing
their displeasure

1048
01:08:12,918 --> 01:08:14,217
with our behavior.

1049
01:08:14,419 --> 01:08:15,718
The silly bastards.

1050
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,387
And what do you believe?

1051
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:19,022
Well...

1052
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:22,892
I believe that Kaiju bone
powder is 500 bucks a pound.

1053
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:26,162
- What do you want?
- I need to access a Kaiju brain.

1054
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:27,530
Completely intact.

1055
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:28,531
No, no, no.

1056
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:29,766
The skull plate is so dense

1057
01:08:29,768 --> 01:08:30,901
that by the time
you drill into it...

1058
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:32,202
The brain's rotted away.

1059
01:08:32,204 --> 01:08:33,970
But I'm talking about
the secondary brain.

1060
01:08:33,972 --> 01:08:36,572
Now we both know
that the Kaiju are so large,

1061
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:39,341
they need two brains to move
around, like a dinosaur.

1062
01:08:39,343 --> 01:08:40,876
I want to get my hands on that.

1063
01:08:40,878 --> 01:08:42,645
Mm.

1064
01:08:42,647 --> 01:08:45,048
What the hell do you want
a secondary brain for, anyway?

1065
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,584
I mean, every part
of the Kaiju sells.

1066
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:49,019
Cartilage, spleen, liver.

1067
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:50,653
Even the crap!

1068
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:52,255
One cubic meter of crap

1069
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:53,715
has enough phosphorous in it

1070
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:55,425
to fertilize a whole field!

1071
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,127
But the brain...

1072
01:08:57,129 --> 01:08:58,928
too much ammonia.

1073
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,697
So what's the deal,
little fella?

1074
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:03,132
Well, that's classified.

1075
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,901
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.

1076
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,603
Mm.

1077
01:09:07,605 --> 01:09:09,505
But it is pretty cool.

1078
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:11,640
So I might tell you.

1079
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:14,009
I'm gonna tell you.

1080
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:16,479
I figured out how to drift
with a Kaiju.

1081
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:18,948
Are you funnin' me, son?

1082
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,884
It's fascinating
how their minds work.

1083
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:23,320
Every single Kaiju,
his mind's connected.

1084
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:26,689
The species has like a...
like a hive mind.

1085
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:32,094
Holy Jesus.

1086
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:34,496
You've gone and done it,
haven't you?

1087
01:09:34,498 --> 01:09:37,199
I did it a little bit, yeah.

1088
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:42,738
You goddamn moron.

1089
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:18,134
Loccent! Typhoon and alpha
are in trouble.

1090
01:11:18,136 --> 01:11:19,369
We're movin' in!

1091
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:21,938
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.

1092
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,606
<i>We need you to carry that bomb.</i>

1093
01:11:23,608 --> 01:11:25,141
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1094
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,105
Jesus, we can't just sit here

1095
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:37,610
and watch 'em die.
Come on!

1096
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,000
Ah, screw this.

1097
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,410
<i>Loccent, we're movin' in now!</i>

1098
01:12:12,756 --> 01:12:15,858
Cherno Alpha, we've been hit
with some type of acid!

1099
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,058
- Come on!
- <i>Hull has been compromised.</i>

1100
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,795
<i>We need backup immediately!</i>

1101
01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:23,666
Just hold on, Cherno!
We're on our way!

1102
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:57,566
Our power move!
Yeah!

1103
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:26,295
We were just lost Cherno, sir.

1104
01:13:49,486 --> 01:13:51,453
Engaging air missiles!

1105
01:14:18,382 --> 01:14:19,816
What's going on?
What happened?

1106
01:14:19,818 --> 01:14:22,585
The blast. It jumbled all the
Jaegers' electrical circuits.

1107
01:14:22,587 --> 01:14:24,053
What the hell was that?

1108
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:25,721
- Loccent!
- I've never seen that before.

1109
01:14:25,723 --> 01:14:27,190
- Loccent!
- They're adapting.

1110
01:14:27,192 --> 01:14:29,025
This isn't a defense mechanism,
it's a weapon!

1111
01:14:29,027 --> 01:14:30,226
Get me Striker!

1112
01:14:30,228 --> 01:14:32,161
Nothing, sir.
The Mark 5's digital's fried.

1113
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:34,597
It'll take me two hours
to reroute the auxiliary.

1114
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:36,332
All the Jaegers,
they're digital!

1115
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:37,600
Not all of them, Marshal.

1116
01:14:38,202 --> 01:14:40,936
Gipsy's analog.
Nuclear.

1117
01:14:55,052 --> 01:14:57,119
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out.

1118
01:14:57,521 --> 01:14:59,989
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
What's going on?

1119
01:14:59,991 --> 01:15:02,692
There are two goddamn Kaiju headed
straight for Hong Kong city.

1120
01:15:02,694 --> 01:15:04,061
No, no, no.
That's not possible.

1121
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:06,762
- There's never been two before.
- Well, maybe that's 'cause

1122
01:15:06,764 --> 01:15:09,865
nobody ever drifted with one
before, eh, genius?!

1123
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:12,667
- When Jaeger pilots drift, it's a two-way street.
- A bridge.

1124
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,100
- A bridge, right?
- Of course. Yes!

1125
01:15:14,105 --> 01:15:15,371
It sets up a connection.

1126
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:17,006
Both ways!

1127
01:15:17,008 --> 01:15:19,742
"A hive mentality," you said!

1128
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:22,378
Maybe those Kaiju
are tryin' to find you.

1129
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,046
What... What're
we gonna do?

1130
01:15:24,048 --> 01:15:25,215
I'm gonna wait out
this shitstorm

1131
01:15:25,217 --> 01:15:27,116
in my own private Kaiju bunker.

1132
01:15:27,118 --> 01:15:29,585
But you are going
to a public refuge.

1133
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:33,823
I tried it once.
Once.

1134
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:35,224
Now get the hell outta here.

1135
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:31,513
Move! Move!
I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!

1136
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:35,984
Okay, hold on.
Let me in.

1137
01:16:35,986 --> 01:16:38,120
Okay, I'm a doctor.
Let me in, I'm a doctor.

1138
01:17:01,846 --> 01:17:03,413
There's no emergency power.

1139
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:05,848
- We gotta bail.
- I'm gonna try somethin' else.

1140
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,383
No!
Don't disengage!

1141
01:17:08,985 --> 01:17:11,486
Aah! My arm!

1142
01:17:11,488 --> 01:17:14,056
Hey! Come on!
Get on your feet, old man!

1143
01:17:14,058 --> 01:17:17,092
Don't call me that!

1144
01:17:22,232 --> 01:17:24,400
He's right outside.
We gotta get outta here now!

1145
01:17:24,402 --> 01:17:25,868
We're not goin' anywhere!

1146
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,303
Now you and I
are the only thing

1147
01:17:27,305 --> 01:17:28,805
standin' between
that ugly bastard

1148
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:30,473
and a city of 2 million people.

1149
01:17:30,475 --> 01:17:31,774
Now we have a choice here.

1150
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:32,808
We either sit and wait

1151
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,144
or we take these flare guns

1152
01:17:34,146 --> 01:17:37,180
and do something really stupid.

1153
01:17:50,728 --> 01:17:52,661
- How's your arm?
- Ah, just give me the gun.

1154
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:56,864
Hey, you!

1155
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:07,276
I think we just pissed it off!

1156
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:34,337
All right, Mako.
Get ready, this is for real!

1157
01:18:46,882 --> 01:18:47,450
Yeah!

1158
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:50,285
Come on, Gipsy!
Kick his ass!

1159
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:42,104
Come on! Let's do this!
Together!

1160
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:03,592
- Elbow rocket!
- <i>Elbow rocket engaged.</i>

1161
01:20:03,594 --> 01:20:04,827
Now!

1162
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:22,577
Aah!

1163
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,770
Hang on, Mako!

1164
01:21:05,522 --> 01:21:07,723
Plasma cannon, now!

1165
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:10,392
<i>Plasma cannon engaged.</i>

1166
01:21:15,164 --> 01:21:19,134
Empty the clip!

1167
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:54,169
Wait.

1168
01:21:55,772 --> 01:21:57,172
I think this guy's dead.

1169
01:21:57,174 --> 01:22:00,876
- But let's check for a pulse.
- Okay.

1170
01:22:09,786 --> 01:22:12,054
No pulse.

1171
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:43,384
He stopped right above us.

1172
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,650
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1173
01:22:45,655 --> 01:22:49,255
This isn't a refuge.
This is a buffet line!

1174
01:22:53,528 --> 01:22:56,431
He knows I'm here.
He knows I'm here!

1175
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:57,533
He knows we're all here!

1176
01:22:57,535 --> 01:22:59,434
No, you don't understand,
he's trying to get me!

1177
01:22:59,836 --> 01:23:01,556
He knows I'm here
and he's trying to get me!

1178
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:03,805
What was that?
What did you say?!

1179
01:23:03,807 --> 01:23:04,940
What was she saying?!

1180
01:23:04,942 --> 01:23:06,741
I gotta get out of here!
Let me out of here!

1181
01:23:07,643 --> 01:23:09,978
Ah, come on!

1182
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,781
Those were expensive glasses.

1183
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:14,382
This is the worst.

1184
01:24:26,923 --> 01:24:30,191
<i>Torque engaged.</i>

1185
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:24,380
I can't pinpoint it.

1186
01:25:24,382 --> 01:25:26,882
It's movin' quick.
Keep your eyes open.

1187
01:25:29,485 --> 01:25:32,654
<i>Choppers,
do you have a visual? Over.</i>

1188
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:16,631
Come on!

1189
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:41,390
I'll hold it!

1190
01:26:41,392 --> 01:26:42,924
Vent the coolant
on the left flank!

1191
01:26:43,126 --> 01:26:44,526
<i>Coolant venting.</i>

1192
01:26:44,728 --> 01:26:46,628
- <i>CO2 purge</i>
- Venting coolant.

1193
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:51,760
<i>Atmosphere loss in progress.</i>

1194
01:27:51,762 --> 01:27:54,296
- Temperature's droppin'!
- We're losing oxygen!

1195
01:27:54,298 --> 01:27:55,764
Both plasma cannons are shot.

1196
01:27:55,766 --> 01:27:57,299
We're out of options, Mako.

1197
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:04,505
<i>Sword deployment.</i>

1198
01:28:24,727 --> 01:28:27,962
<i>Altitude actuation
off-balance.</i>

1199
01:28:28,564 --> 01:28:32,800
<i>50,000 feet to ground contact.</i>

1200
01:28:33,903 --> 01:28:36,938
Look, there!

1201
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,474
<i>Altitude loss critical.</i>

1202
01:28:41,044 --> 01:28:42,410
<i>40,000 feet.</i>

1203
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:46,581
Gipsy, listen to me!

1204
01:28:46,783 --> 01:28:48,517
<i>Loosen all the shock absorbers,</i>

1205
01:28:48,519 --> 01:28:50,785
<i>Use your gyroscope as balance
and ball up!</i>

1206
01:28:50,787 --> 01:28:52,687
<i>It's your only chance!</i>

1207
01:28:53,089 --> 01:28:56,124
<i>20,000 feet.</i>

1208
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:57,893
<i>Fuel purge!</i>

1209
01:28:57,895 --> 01:28:59,594
<i>Now!</i>

1210
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:03,932
<i>Impact alert.</i>

1211
01:29:03,934 --> 01:29:05,700
We're comin' in too fast.

1212
01:29:05,702 --> 01:29:09,003
We're comin' in too fast.
Brace for impact, ma...

1213
01:29:36,499 --> 01:29:39,100
Mako, talk to me.

1214
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,571
Mako, you okay?

1215
01:29:43,973 --> 01:29:46,074
Yeah.

1216
01:29:46,076 --> 01:29:47,342
You?

1217
01:30:02,091 --> 01:30:04,459
- Go to Dr. Geiszler now!
- Yes, sir!

1218
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:07,962
I want the two remaining Jaegers
back to 100% functionality.

1219
01:30:07,964 --> 01:30:09,297
Yes, sir!

1220
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,000
<i>We're gonna harvest</i>

1221
01:30:12,002 --> 01:30:14,268
the skin,
the talons and the wing.

1222
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,504
Germans are gonna go nuts
for that stuff.

1223
01:30:16,506 --> 01:30:18,706
Let me see that map.

1224
01:30:20,509 --> 01:30:22,210
Here is where the Kaiju fell,

1225
01:30:22,612 --> 01:30:24,445
here's where we concentrate
our efforts.

1226
01:30:24,447 --> 01:30:25,580
- We'll get it, boss.
- Right.

1227
01:30:25,582 --> 01:30:26,982
Hey!

1228
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:32,087
Okay, guess who's back,
you one-eyed bitch?

1229
01:30:32,889 --> 01:30:35,690
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.

1230
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:50,470
Raleigh!

1231
01:30:55,344 --> 01:30:57,712
My kid'd never admit it...

1232
01:30:58,114 --> 01:30:59,647
but he's grateful.

1233
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:00,915
We both are.

1234
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,722
Mr. Becket!

1235
01:31:07,724 --> 01:31:10,292
Miss Mori!

1236
01:31:11,594 --> 01:31:13,761
In all of my years fighting...

1237
01:31:15,163 --> 01:31:20,601
I've never seen anything
like that.

1238
01:31:20,603 --> 01:31:22,837
Well done.

1239
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:25,506
Proud of you.

1240
01:31:26,108 --> 01:31:28,142
Proud of us all.

1241
01:31:28,144 --> 01:31:30,011
But...

1242
01:31:30,613 --> 01:31:37,017
as harsh as it sounds,
there is no time to celebrate.

1243
01:31:38,454 --> 01:31:41,489
We lost two crews.

1244
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:45,393
No time to grieve.

1245
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:50,598
Reset that clock.

1246
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:04,712
Reset the clock.

1247
01:32:36,445 --> 01:32:38,213
I still can't believe
what you did to me.

1248
01:32:38,215 --> 01:32:39,781
I mean, I coulda been eaten.

1249
01:32:39,883 --> 01:32:41,716
Well, that was definitely
the plan.

1250
01:32:41,918 --> 01:32:44,118
Lucky for you, that didn't
become necessary, huh?

1251
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,887
Okay. Thank you so much.
You're so kind.

1252
01:32:45,889 --> 01:32:47,355
I really appreciate
all of this.

1253
01:32:47,357 --> 01:32:49,491
But now do you mind tellin' me
exactly what is taking so long

1254
01:32:49,493 --> 01:32:51,026
for your workers
to get that brain?

1255
01:32:51,028 --> 01:32:53,728
Well, they pump the cavity
full of CO2,

1256
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:55,963
just like in any other
laparoscopic surgery.

1257
01:32:55,965 --> 01:32:57,032
Okay, yes, obviously.

1258
01:32:57,034 --> 01:32:59,401
The CO2's gonna delay
the acidic reaction, yes.

1259
01:32:59,403 --> 01:33:01,169
And it allows us to harvest.

1260
01:33:01,371 --> 01:33:03,772
But our boys need oxygen
pumped into their suits.

1261
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:05,107
They move slow.

1262
01:33:06,009 --> 01:33:07,808
What's goin' on in there, boys?

1263
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:09,277
<i>We've reached...</i>

1264
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:10,912
The upper pelvic area.

1265
01:33:11,714 --> 01:33:14,915
Moving to the 25th vertebra.

1266
01:33:15,117 --> 01:33:16,784
Shit.

1267
01:33:16,786 --> 01:33:18,119
Even through the suit, boss,

1268
01:33:18,121 --> 01:33:21,356
It smells like dead catfish
in here.

1269
01:33:25,492 --> 01:33:26,627
Boss.

1270
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:29,364
The secondary brain...

1271
01:33:29,466 --> 01:33:30,598
- <i>...is damage</i>
- Oh.

1272
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,333
- <i>It's ruin. Destroy</i>
- Bitch!

1273
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:33,368
How could they screw that up?!

1274
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,603
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

1275
01:33:35,605 --> 01:33:36,437
What was that?
Did he say "wait"?

1276
01:33:36,439 --> 01:33:38,106
Why wait?

1277
01:33:40,242 --> 01:33:41,710
Do you hear that?

1278
01:33:42,212 --> 01:33:44,412
It's like a heartbeat.

1279
01:33:45,314 --> 01:33:47,314
Oh, my God.

1280
01:33:47,416 --> 01:33:48,416
Oh, my God, this can't be.
Hold on.

1281
01:33:48,418 --> 01:33:50,218
Hey!
Let me have that!

1282
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,220
Shh, shh!
Listen, listen!

1283
01:33:52,422 --> 01:33:54,322
Listen to this.

1284
01:34:02,998 --> 01:34:05,499
It's pregnant.

1285
01:35:01,956 --> 01:35:04,859
No, no! Please.

1286
01:35:04,961 --> 01:35:08,095
No! No.

1287
01:35:22,945 --> 01:35:25,879
- I knew it.
- Aah!

1288
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:27,347
Gone.

1289
01:35:27,549 --> 01:35:30,550
His lungs weren't fully formed.

1290
01:35:30,552 --> 01:35:33,354
Umbilical cord
tied around his neck.

1291
01:35:33,556 --> 01:35:36,491
No way he could survive
outside the womb for...

1292
01:35:36,493 --> 01:35:38,026
for more than a minute.

1293
01:35:38,028 --> 01:35:40,061
One look, that's all I needed.

1294
01:35:40,663 --> 01:35:42,530
I knew he wouldn't make it.

1295
01:35:51,341 --> 01:35:52,474
Ugly little bastard.

1296
01:35:53,276 --> 01:35:55,242
Anyway, I woulda...

1297
01:36:13,396 --> 01:36:16,364
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1298
01:36:29,578 --> 01:36:31,312
Huh.

1299
01:36:41,257 --> 01:36:43,524
How sick are you?

1300
01:36:43,526 --> 01:36:45,659
And why didn't you tell me?

1301
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:48,896
Ah.

1302
01:36:48,898 --> 01:36:53,000
What's to tell?

1303
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:54,802
You know, them Mark 1s,

1304
01:36:54,804 --> 01:37:00,374
we scraped them bad boys
together in 14 months.

1305
01:37:01,076 --> 01:37:06,046
Last thing we were thinking
about was radiation shielding.

1306
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,350
I ran nearly a dozen missions.

1307
01:37:09,952 --> 01:37:12,287
I stayed under
the medical radar for awhile

1308
01:37:12,289 --> 01:37:15,657
but the last time I jockeyed
was Tokyo.

1309
01:37:15,859 --> 01:37:19,360
I finished the fight solo,
but for three hours...

1310
01:37:19,962 --> 01:37:21,196
I burned.

1311
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:24,132
They warned me if I ever stepped
foot into a Jaeger again,

1312
01:37:24,134 --> 01:37:25,567
the toll would be too much.

1313
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:31,739
You and I are the only two
that ever ran solo combat.

1314
01:37:32,341 --> 01:37:35,042
That's why I brought you here.

1315
01:37:43,952 --> 01:37:45,853
- What is it?
- <i>Sir, it's happening.</i>

1316
01:37:45,855 --> 01:37:46,955
<i>I just got two signatures</i>

1317
01:37:46,957 --> 01:37:49,624
<i>with unprecedented dilation,
40 meter spikes.</i>

1318
01:37:49,826 --> 01:37:50,992
What category?

1319
01:37:50,994 --> 01:37:52,660
<i>Checking the ratios,
category four.</i>

1320
01:37:53,162 --> 01:37:54,029
Where're they headed?

1321
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:55,297
<i>That's the thing,
they're not headin' anywhere.</i>

1322
01:37:55,299 --> 01:37:56,999
<i>They're hovering
just above the breach.</i>

1323
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:59,068
<i>It's... It's like they're
protecting it or something.</i>

1324
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:01,937
All right, Gipsy, Striker,
on deck.

1325
01:38:01,939 --> 01:38:05,240
<i>Sir, Herc cannot ride.
His arm...</i>

1326
01:38:05,242 --> 01:38:07,041
You heard me.

1327
01:38:08,643 --> 01:38:10,144
Two signatures.

1328
01:38:10,146 --> 01:38:12,413
Two?! There are...

1329
01:38:12,415 --> 01:38:14,882
there are two Kaiju
signatures in the breach,

1330
01:38:14,984 --> 01:38:16,317
not three like I predicted?!

1331
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:18,520
Hermann! I haven't exactly had
a very good day, okay?!

1332
01:38:19,022 --> 01:38:20,788
I got about 5 minutes...

1333
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,356
Should be three Kaijus.

1334
01:38:22,358 --> 01:38:24,058
...before brain death
occurs here!

1335
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,360
I don't wanna spend it talking
about your theories!

1336
01:38:26,362 --> 01:38:27,362
This is all wrong!

1337
01:38:27,364 --> 01:38:29,898
There should be three Kaijus
coming through, not two!

1338
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,599
Oh, there should be three
and there's two?

1339
01:38:31,601 --> 01:38:33,368
- I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong, doesn't it, Hermann?
- I'm not wrong

1340
01:38:33,370 --> 01:38:34,450
but there is something here

1341
01:38:34,468 --> 01:38:36,307
- that we don't understand.
- Okay. Hermann, hopefully we

1342
01:38:36,317 --> 01:38:37,438
can argue about any mistakes

1343
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,040
you made in your predictive
model in the future!

1344
01:38:39,042 --> 01:38:39,908
But in the meantime,

1345
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:41,576
the neural interface
is way off the charts!

1346
01:38:41,578 --> 01:38:42,677
If you want to help,
help with that!

1347
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:44,479
Newton, I am not wrong.

1348
01:38:44,481 --> 01:38:46,347
There is only one way
to make sure...

1349
01:38:47,149 --> 01:38:49,884
and that is to do this...

1350
01:38:49,886 --> 01:38:51,485
together.

1351
01:38:51,887 --> 01:38:54,021
I'll go with you.

1352
01:38:54,023 --> 01:38:56,557
That's what
the Jaeger pilots do,

1353
01:38:56,559 --> 01:38:58,426
share the neural load.

1354
01:38:58,628 --> 01:39:01,830
You're serious?
You would do that for me?

1355
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:04,432
Or you would do that with me?

1356
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:08,503
Well, with worldwide destruction
a certain alternative...

1357
01:39:08,805 --> 01:39:10,338
do I really have a choice?

1358
01:39:10,363 --> 01:39:11,639
Be safe with me, my man.

1359
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,741
"We're gonna own this bad boy!"

1360
01:39:13,943 --> 01:39:18,379
By Jove, we are going to own
this thing for sure!

1361
01:39:23,818 --> 01:39:27,221
Oi, Tendo.
Tendo!

1362
01:39:27,623 --> 01:39:28,956
You're not suited up.

1363
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,324
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.

1364
01:39:30,326 --> 01:39:31,659
I need to know what's going on.

1365
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:33,294
He said suit up, so suit up.

1366
01:39:33,496 --> 01:39:36,464
Tendo, I can't pilot Striker
on my own, now, can I?!

1367
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:39,099
Dad's hurt, so who's gonna
be my copilot?

1368
01:40:01,322 --> 01:40:05,158
I don't remember it
being so tight.

1369
01:40:06,395 --> 01:40:10,598
Getting back into that Jaeger
will kill you.

1370
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,768
Not gettin' into one
would kill us all.

1371
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:19,607
Listen, you are a brave girl.

1372
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:23,911
I'm so lucky
to have seen you grow.

1373
01:40:24,313 --> 01:40:27,181
But if I'm going to do this...

1374
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:32,119
I need you to protect me.

1375
01:40:34,756 --> 01:40:37,458
Can you do that?

1376
01:40:41,862 --> 01:40:43,496
Hey.

1377
01:40:45,734 --> 01:40:49,803
Everyone, listen up!

1378
01:40:55,711 --> 01:40:58,079
Today...

1379
01:40:58,681 --> 01:41:01,649
today...

1380
01:41:01,651 --> 01:41:04,318
at the edge of our hope...

1381
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:10,958
at the end of our time...

1382
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:14,129
we have chosen not only
to believe in ourselves,

1383
01:41:14,131 --> 01:41:16,498
but in each other.

1384
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,468
Today there's not a man
nor woman in here

1385
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:22,569
that shall stand alone.

1386
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:25,705
Not today.

1387
01:41:25,707 --> 01:41:29,543
Today we face the monsters
that are at our door

1388
01:41:29,545 --> 01:41:32,146
and bring the fight to them!

1389
01:41:32,348 --> 01:41:36,717
Today we are canceling
the apocalypse!

1390
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,368
<i>Go to the safety zone
right now.</i>

1391
01:41:56,404 --> 01:41:57,704
Hey, Marshal!

1392
01:41:57,706 --> 01:41:59,374
You know,
that was a great speech,

1393
01:41:59,376 --> 01:42:02,978
but how exactly are you and I
supposed to match up in there?

1394
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,448
I carry nothing into the drift.

1395
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:08,884
No memories, no fear.
No rank.

1396
01:42:09,686 --> 01:42:10,985
And as for you...

1397
01:42:11,487 --> 01:42:13,454
well, you're easy.

1398
01:42:13,456 --> 01:42:16,156
You're an egotistical jerk
with daddy issues.

1399
01:42:16,358 --> 01:42:18,592
A simple puzzle I solved
on day one.

1400
01:42:20,196 --> 01:42:22,963
But you are
your father's son...

1401
01:42:23,365 --> 01:42:25,399
so we'll drift just fine.

1402
01:42:26,001 --> 01:42:29,436
Works for me.

1403
01:42:43,418 --> 01:42:45,152
Hey, now.

1404
01:42:49,257 --> 01:42:53,661
When you drift with someone,

1405
01:42:53,663 --> 01:42:56,864
you feel like there's nothing
to talk about.

1406
01:42:59,166 --> 01:43:02,237
I just don't want to regret all the
things that I never said out loud.

1407
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,038
Don't.

1408
01:43:06,942 --> 01:43:09,476
You don't need to.

1409
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,848
I know them all.

1410
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:17,117
I always have.

1411
01:43:19,054 --> 01:43:21,388
Hey.
Hey, handsome.

1412
01:43:24,059 --> 01:43:26,927
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

1413
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:36,570
You look after him for me.

1414
01:43:36,572 --> 01:43:38,138
Stacker.

1415
01:43:40,308 --> 01:43:42,910
That's my son you got there.

1416
01:43:44,713 --> 01:43:47,214
My son.

1417
01:43:51,853 --> 01:43:56,590
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent livin' in the past,

1418
01:43:56,792 --> 01:44:00,360
I never really thought
about the future.

1419
01:44:01,162 --> 01:44:03,963
Until now.

1420
01:44:05,267 --> 01:44:09,302
I never did have
very good timing.

1421
01:44:26,288 --> 01:44:27,621
You ready for this?

1422
01:44:28,023 --> 01:44:28,789
Oh, yes, yes.

1423
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:32,026
Initiating neural
handshake in 5...

1424
01:44:32,228 --> 01:44:36,630
4, 3, 2, 1.

1425
01:44:59,889 --> 01:45:01,989
Are you okay?

1426
01:45:01,991 --> 01:45:03,991
Yes, of course.

1427
01:45:04,393 --> 01:45:07,060
I'm completely fine.

1428
01:45:14,235 --> 01:45:16,069
The drift.
You saw it?

1429
01:45:16,071 --> 01:45:17,337
Yeah.
Did you?

1430
01:45:17,339 --> 01:45:19,006
Listen, we have to warn them.

1431
01:45:19,008 --> 01:45:22,309
The Jaegers...
the breach... the plan...

1432
01:45:22,411 --> 01:45:24,545
It's not going to work.

1433
01:45:25,347 --> 01:45:29,316
<i>Disengaging transport.</i>

1434
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,793
<i>Loccent, all ports sealed.</i>

1435
01:45:39,795 --> 01:45:42,724
- <i>Ready to submerge.
- All ports sealed. Ready to submerge.</i>

1436
01:45:50,371 --> 01:45:53,440
Both neural handshakes at 100%.

1437
01:45:53,442 --> 01:45:55,709
Neural handshake
confirmed, sir.

1438
01:45:55,711 --> 01:45:58,579
Two actives still in circle
formation in the Guam quadrant.

1439
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:00,748
<i>Codename: Scunner, Raiju.</i>

1440
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,384
- <i>Both category 4.
- Roger that.</i>

1441
01:46:03,386 --> 01:46:07,054
Half a mile to
the ocean cliff, we jump!

1442
01:46:07,056 --> 01:46:09,023
It's 3,000 meters
to the breach.

1443
01:46:09,225 --> 01:46:11,759
Half a mile?! I can't even see
a damn inch ahead!

1444
01:46:12,061 --> 01:46:14,962
<i>How are we supposed
to deliver the bomb?</i>

1445
01:46:16,831 --> 01:46:18,265
Visibility's zero.

1446
01:46:18,267 --> 01:46:19,767
Switching to instruments now.

1447
01:46:28,878 --> 01:46:30,511
Sir!

1448
01:46:30,513 --> 01:46:32,680
Gipsy, <i>you have movement
on your right. Three o'clock!</i>

1449
01:46:32,682 --> 01:46:33,615
<i>Three o'clock!</i>

1450
01:46:33,617 --> 01:46:35,417
<i>100 feet radius, clear.</i>

1451
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:38,319
Right flank's clear.
I got nothing.

1452
01:46:38,321 --> 01:46:39,787
Left now!
And movin' fast!

1453
01:46:39,889 --> 01:46:41,355
Fastest Kaiju on record!

1454
01:46:44,926 --> 01:46:47,595
I don't see anything.
It's movin' too fast!

1455
01:46:47,597 --> 01:46:51,732
<i>Eyes on the prize, Gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.</i>

1456
01:47:17,058 --> 01:47:20,460
<i>400 meters and closing.</i>

1457
01:47:24,165 --> 01:47:26,434
Bogeys are stopping.

1458
01:47:27,336 --> 01:47:28,114
<i>Striker!</i>

1459
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,738
<i>Bogeys are stopping.
One o'clock.</i>

1460
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,206
Marshal, what are you doing?!

1461
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:33,374
They're stopping.

1462
01:47:33,376 --> 01:47:35,778
- Why the hell are they stopping?!
- I don't give a damn, sir!

1463
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:37,977
- We're 300 meters from the jump!
- Something's not right!

1464
01:47:37,987 --> 01:47:39,146
<i>Striker, the bogeys
aren't following.</i>

1465
01:47:39,148 --> 01:47:40,981
Take the leap now!

1466
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,784
Don't do it! Don't do it,
it's not gonna work!

1467
01:47:43,786 --> 01:47:44,819
Move, you fascist!

1468
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:46,787
Blowing up the breach,
it's not gonna work!

1469
01:47:46,789 --> 01:47:48,122
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?

1470
01:47:48,124 --> 01:47:49,390
Sir, just because
the breach is open

1471
01:47:49,392 --> 01:47:50,959
does not mean you're gonna be
able to get a bomb through.

1472
01:47:50,961 --> 01:47:52,527
<i>The breach
genetically reads the Kaiju.</i>

1473
01:47:52,529 --> 01:47:53,809
Like a barcode at
the supermarket

1474
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:54,829
and then lets them pass.

1475
01:47:54,831 --> 01:47:56,264
Okay, so you're gonna
have to fool the breach

1476
01:47:56,266 --> 01:47:58,132
into thinking that you have
the same code!

1477
01:47:58,134 --> 01:47:59,768
And how are we supposed
to do that?

1478
01:47:59,770 --> 01:48:01,336
By making it think
you are a Kaiju.

1479
01:48:01,338 --> 01:48:03,604
You have to lock onto the
Kaiju, ride it into the breach.

1480
01:48:03,606 --> 01:48:04,672
The throat will then read

1481
01:48:04,674 --> 01:48:07,007
<i>the Kaiju's genetic code
and let you pass.</i>

1482
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:09,310
<i>If you don't do it, the bomb
will deflect off the breach</i>

1483
01:48:09,312 --> 01:48:11,412
<i>like it always has</i>
and the mission will fail.

1484
01:48:11,614 --> 01:48:13,547
All right, now that
you've heard all that,

1485
01:48:13,549 --> 01:48:14,516
Striker, take the leap!

1486
01:48:14,518 --> 01:48:16,885
Sir! I have a third signature
emerging from the breach!

1487
01:48:16,987 --> 01:48:18,820
Third signature
emerging from the breach.

1488
01:48:19,422 --> 01:48:22,223
- It's a triple event.
- Oh, God, I was right.

1489
01:48:23,025 --> 01:48:26,260
How big is it?
<i>What category?</i>

1490
01:48:26,262 --> 01:48:27,494
Category 5.

1491
01:48:28,596 --> 01:48:29,963
Striker,

1492
01:48:29,965 --> 01:48:31,798
<i>it's a category 5.</i>

1493
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,800
<i>The first ever.</i>

1494
01:48:57,825 --> 01:48:59,092
<i>Striker, we see him.</i>

1495
01:48:59,094 --> 01:49:01,095
<i>We're right behind you,
about 100 meters.</i>

1496
01:49:01,097 --> 01:49:02,797
<i>We're gonna come around
your three o'clock,</i>

1497
01:49:02,799 --> 01:49:04,132
<i>try to flank him.</i>

1498
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:05,566
<i>Standard two-team
formation.</i>

1499
01:49:05,768 --> 01:49:07,601
<i>Just keep him busy
for a few mi...</i>

1500
01:49:20,081 --> 01:49:22,049
Brace for impact!

1501
01:49:28,257 --> 01:49:30,291
<i>Chain sword deployed.</i>

1502
01:49:55,116 --> 01:49:59,119
<i>Let's get this son of a bitch!</i>

1503
01:50:18,806 --> 01:50:21,008
<i>Gipsy, comin' up
on your 12 o'clock!</i>

1504
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,843
<i>Full speed!</i>

1505
01:50:23,245 --> 01:50:25,312
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

1506
01:50:44,165 --> 01:50:45,432
The release is jammed!

1507
01:50:45,934 --> 01:50:48,535
We can't deliver
the payload, sir!

1508
01:50:48,537 --> 01:50:50,170
<i>We're still armed.</i>

1509
01:50:50,172 --> 01:50:52,139
But the hull is compromised!

1510
01:50:52,141 --> 01:50:53,674
Half our systems
are offline, sir.

1511
01:50:53,676 --> 01:50:55,075
We need to override the...

1512
01:50:59,581 --> 01:51:00,814
Aah!

1513
01:51:43,624 --> 01:51:46,526
Both Kaijus converging
on Striker fast!

1514
01:51:48,297 --> 01:51:51,632
<i>Hang on, Striker!
We're comin' to ya!</i>

1515
01:51:51,634 --> 01:51:54,202
No! Gipsy!
Do not come to our aid!

1516
01:51:54,704 --> 01:51:56,170
- Do you copy?
- Hang on!

1517
01:51:56,172 --> 01:51:57,571
<i>Stay as far back as you can!</i>

1518
01:51:57,673 --> 01:52:00,073
We can still reach you.
We're comin' for you.

1519
01:52:00,575 --> 01:52:02,876
No, Raleigh, listen to me.

1520
01:52:02,878 --> 01:52:04,478
You know exactly
what you have to do!

1521
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,946
<i>Gipsy is nuclear!</i>

1522
01:52:05,948 --> 01:52:07,781
<i>Take her to the breach!</i>

1523
01:52:07,783 --> 01:52:08,849
I hear you, sir.

1524
01:52:09,251 --> 01:52:10,518
Headin' for the breach.

1525
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,953
- <i>Structural damage, 80%</i>
- Now...

1526
01:52:14,355 --> 01:52:18,090
<i>Mako. Listen.</i>

1527
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:21,761
You can finish this.

1528
01:52:21,763 --> 01:52:24,597
I'll always be here for you.

1529
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:28,000
You can always find me
in the drift.

1530
01:52:32,609 --> 01:52:34,675
We're a walking
nuclear reactor.

1531
01:52:35,677 --> 01:52:37,811
We can destroy the breach.

1532
01:52:51,059 --> 01:52:53,293
What can we do, sir?

1533
01:52:53,295 --> 01:52:55,428
We can clear a path!

1534
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:58,031
For the lady!

1535
01:52:58,133 --> 01:53:00,233
They're gonna detonate
the payload.

1536
01:53:00,255 --> 01:53:02,655
<i>Well, my father always said,</i>

1537
01:53:02,738 --> 01:53:05,672
He said if you have the shot,
you take it!

1538
01:53:05,674 --> 01:53:09,076
<i>So let's do this!</i>

1539
01:53:10,078 --> 01:53:12,945
It was a pleasure, sir.

1540
01:53:37,572 --> 01:53:38,572

<i>Fluid loss.</i>

01:54:13,742 --> 01:54:15,609
Systems are critical!

Fuel is leaking!

1546
01:54:17,413 --> 01:54:18,479
Our right leg's crippled!

01:54:19,081 --> 01:54:20,147
<i>Code red.</i>

1549
01:54:22,984 --> 01:54:25,118
What are they doing?

1550
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,353
Finishing the mission.

1551
01:54:26,355 --> 01:54:29,055
<i>Loccent.
We have the Kaiju carcass.</i>

1552

<i>We're heading for the breach.</i>

1553

<i>You guys better be right.</i>

1554
01:54:35,864 --> 01:54:40,600
<i>'Cause one way or another,

1555
01:54:51,879 --> 01:54:54,814
On my count, rear jets!

1556
01:54:54,916 --> 01:54:58,652
Three, two, one.

1557
01:54:58,754 --> 01:54:59,920
Now!

1558
01:55:08,329 --> 01:55:10,097
Hold on.

1559
01:55:22,510 --> 01:55:25,512
Mako's oxygen is down.
Half capacity!

1560
01:55:26,214 --> 01:55:28,681
- Can you reroute it?
- I'm tryin', sir.

1561
01:55:28,683 --> 01:55:30,450
- Hold on, Mako.
- <i>Heat shaft purge.</i>

1562
01:55:30,452 --> 01:55:34,287
I'm gonna burn
this son of a bitch.

1563
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:52,605
They're in.

1564
01:55:52,607 --> 01:55:54,708
- They're in!
- It worked.

1565
01:56:08,322 --> 01:56:13,092
<i>Oxygen main, left hemisphere,

<i>...Critical level.</i>

1573
01:56:30,445 --> 01:56:31,845
We did it.

1574
01:56:32,147 --> 01:56:34,981
I can finish this alone.

1575
01:56:35,083 --> 01:56:37,583
All I have to do is fall.

1576
01:56:37,685 --> 01:56:40,086
Anyone can fall.

1577
01:56:40,088 --> 01:56:42,856
<i>Raleigh, your oxygen

<i>You don't have much time.</i>

<i>Start the core meltdown

01:56:48,664 --> 01:56:50,497
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

1582
01:56:57,939 --> 01:57:01,108
One pod is ejected.
No detonation, sir.

1583

<i>Loccent,

1584
01:57:03,078 --> 01:57:06,346
I'm initiating

<i>Manual activation required.</i>

1587
01:57:12,088 --> 01:57:13,287
He has to do it by hand.

1588
01:57:13,389 --> 01:57:14,588
He's out of time.

1589
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:15,889
He has to
self-destruct now.

1590
01:57:18,659 --> 01:57:21,828
<i>Manual activation required.</i>

1591
01:57:32,206 --> 01:57:34,441
No!

1592
01:57:51,391 --> 01:57:54,293
Manual override initiated.

1593
01:57:54,295 --> 01:57:56,997
Core meltdown in T-minus 60.

1594
01:57:56,999 --> 01:58:00,434
<i>Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.</i>

1595
01:58:03,704 --> 01:58:05,572
<i>50 seconds.</i>

1596
01:58:37,038 --> 01:58:40,773
<i>Evac pod engaged.</i>

1597
01:58:46,681 --> 01:58:53,787
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

1598
01:58:53,789 --> 01:58:56,189
<i>Reactor meltdown commence.</i>

1599
01:59:02,429 --> 01:59:04,797
Direct hit!
The breach has collapsed!

1600
01:59:07,902 --> 01:59:09,502
To the choppers!

1601
01:59:09,604 --> 01:59:11,738
To the choppers now!

1602
01:59:28,122 --> 01:59:29,956
Visuals on first pod.

1603
01:59:29,958 --> 01:59:32,726
<i>Tracking solid.
Vital signs are good.</i>

1604
01:59:38,366 --> 01:59:40,834
Okay, where's the second pod?

1605
01:59:40,836 --> 01:59:44,004
I'm tracking it, but I'm
getting no vital signs.

1606
02:00:11,298 --> 02:00:13,399
<i>I can't find his pulse.</i>

1607
02:00:13,401 --> 02:00:14,901
<i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>

1608
02:00:14,903 --> 02:00:16,102
Can you read his pulse?

1609
02:00:16,104 --> 02:00:17,437
- <i>Raleigh?</i>
- Does he have a pulse?

1610
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:18,838
- <i>Raleigh?</i>
- I don't know.

1611
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,674
<i>Mako, listen to me.</i>

1612
02:00:20,676 --> 02:00:23,176
<i>It could be the sensors
are not working.</i>

1613
02:00:23,178 --> 02:00:24,711
<i>We can't be sure.</i>

1614
02:00:25,213 --> 02:00:26,379
No.

1615
02:00:26,481 --> 02:00:29,582
No. Don't go.

1616
02:00:29,584 --> 02:00:31,517
<i>Mako.</i>

1617
02:00:31,519 --> 02:00:33,052
Don't go.

1618
02:00:33,054 --> 02:00:35,588
<i>Mako.</i>

1619
02:00:38,492 --> 02:00:41,527
Don't go. Please.

1620
02:00:43,263 --> 02:00:45,965
You're squeezing me too tight.

1621
02:00:52,171 --> 02:00:56,773
I couldn't breathe.

1622
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:11,658
This is
Marshal Hercules Hansen.

1623
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:15,028
<i>The breach is sealed.</i>

1624
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:16,296
Stop the clock!

1625
02:01:44,624 --> 02:01:46,293
<i>Mako, Raleigh.
We have your position.</i>

1626
02:01:46,295 --> 02:01:49,696
<i>The choppers are on their way.
Just hang on.</i>

1627
02:01:53,067 --> 02:01:55,301
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1628
02:01:55,303 --> 02:01:58,103
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1629
02:01:58,106 --> 02:02:00,566
<i>Uh, guys?</i>

1630
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:03,150
Where is my goddamn shoe?
