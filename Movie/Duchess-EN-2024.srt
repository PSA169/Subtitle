1
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,207

2
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,481
Are you gonna come in?

3
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,250
Or you gonna
stand there and drool?

4
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,987
You've got a mouth on you.

5
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,188
'What else is it good for?'

6
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,426
Why don't you come in
and you'll find out?

7
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,964
So what's your name, pretty?

8
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,732
Call me whatever you like.

9
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,869
I'm yours for tonight.
Courtesy of Santiago.

10
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,674
Since you look
good enough to eat,

11
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,276
I think I can call you...

12
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,914
...Candy.

13
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,883

14
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,285
What makes you think I'm sweet?

15
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,792
Now, why don't you
show it to me.

16
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,293
Wow.

17
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,330
Whatever you say, beauty.

18
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,265

19
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,372
Like a baby's arm
holding an apple, huh?

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,909
About big enough for the birds,
I reckon.

21
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,911
What the...

22
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:29,516
Just like cocks, power comes in
all different shapes and sizes.

23
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,753
You name it.
Sex, money, class, politics.

24
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,554
Or just the sheer will
to put the other man down

25
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,355
and leave 'em bleeding
on the floor.

26
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,525
But power
is nothing without respect.

27
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,061
If they don't respect you,
sooner or later some cunt

28
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:43,262
is gonna come along and take
that power away from you.

29
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,565

30
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,135
You!

31
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,770
Fucking kill him.

32
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,938

33
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,877


34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,980

35
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,049
So this is me. Name's Scarlett.

36
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,884
London girl,
through and through.

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,652
The big bastard is Nacho,
but don't lose

38
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,921
any sleep over him,
he totally has it coming.

39
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,756


40
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,857
You're not real.

41
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,358
This feel real enough?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,928

43
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,864
Oh, you dirty fucker.

44
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,768
Oh, hello.

45
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,770

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,006
Oh, no.


47
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,140
As you can probably tell
I've come

48
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,142
a long way from Peckham.

49
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,811
But I ain't done anything
to be ashamed of.

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,512


51
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,581


52
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,084
Well...

53
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,151
Fuck sake!

54
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,187
Not much anyway.

55
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,823


56
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,769
Actually hang on a minute. I'm
getting way ahead of myself.

57
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,270
To really understand
where this all started

58
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,773
we have to go back a bit.

59
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,908


60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,917
Back to when I met the man
who changed everything.

61
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,987
No, not him.
That's just a mark.

62
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,126
And not him either.
That's Adam.

63
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,427
Think of him like
Fagin to me Artful Dodger.

64
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,965
Wherever I could pinch, he took
his cut and watched my back.

65
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,399
Now, that's my bestie,
Michelle.

66
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,037
Alright, babe, let's go to work.

67
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,240
If we saw an opportunity
we took it.

68
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,709
Back then I had
fuck all to lose.

69
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,578


70
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,895
No, I'm talking about the other
bloke in the background

71
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,563
who I didn't even see coming.

72
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,668


73
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,390


74
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,897
Yeah.

75
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,534
Okay.

76
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,304
Was that Victor?

77
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,439
We're all set. Charlie takes
delivery on Friday.

78
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,644


79
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,463
Hey, whoa, whoa.

80
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,398
Let's not ruin the moment.

81
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,902
I've been watching you work.
You got some nice moves.

82
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,237
- What is this, a bust?
- No.

83
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,470
Cops don't cut the hands
off the people

84
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,506
they catch stealing from them.

85
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,377
- I'm just kidding.
- So how's about you let me go?

86
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,746
How's about I don't?

87
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,413
Listen, my boyfriend's
over there

88
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,049
and you do not want
to mess with him.

89
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,286
So do yourself a favor
and piss off.

90
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,888
You do have a sting
in your tail, don't you?

91
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,090
Yeah, that's right.
So sling your hook.

92
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,292
- He's not your boyfriend
- Oh, yeah?

93
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,427
He's beneath you.
Anyone can see that.

94
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,130
You are all charm, ain't ya?

95
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,166
Now, how about you let me go?

96
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,703
I think you owe me a drink.

97
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,473
You really are a glutton
for punishment.

98
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,441
Do I look like I give a shit?

99
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,413
Vodka, straight up.

100
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,650
Single malt scotch on the rocks.

101
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,455
Thank you.

102
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,794


103
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,701
You better drink that quick.

104
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,468
'Cause when he sees you over
here, he'll be in your face

105
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,605
with a broken bottle,
before you can blink.

106
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,041
So listen to my eyes
and walk away.

107
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,811
Why don't you walk away,
I'll take my chances.

108
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,446
You got some bollocks on you,
I'll give you that.

109
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,549
When you're down there
gettin your face

110
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,151
stitched back on,
don't say I didn't warn you.

111
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,354
Look, we can dance around this
all night, or we can just

112
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,190
cut to the chance. I like you.

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,759
Well, you can't have me.

114
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,995
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

115
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,065
Get yourself a new watch
while you're at it.

116
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,833
That one's fucked.

117
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,436
You're very observant.

118
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,538
Oh, I have to be,
in my line, you know.

119
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,108
Fuck, here he comes.

120
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,545
What's going on here then?

121
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,613
Are you bothering my girl?

122
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,516
Here we go.

123
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,952
Never a dull fucking moment.

124
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,687
Will you excuse me, ladies?

125
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,056
He's nobody, he was just asking
for time, alright?

126
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,625
You hear that? You're nobody.

127
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,394
You wanna know what time it is.

128
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,997
It's time to fuck off, mate.
Go on.

129
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,531
There's a good boy.

130
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,502


131
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,539
Everything alright here, gents?

132
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,744
We're bailing. You've attracted
enough attention for one night.

133
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,217
Take care of it,
will you, Jimmy?

134
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,955
Oi, oi. Not so fast.

135
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,991
Are you sure you wanna do this?

136
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,830
That's Rob McNaughton.
The future love of my life.

137
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:55,235
Ex-marine, ex-con, excellent
in bed as it turned out.

138
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,872
And oh, yeah,
extremely fucking dangerous.

139
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,810


140
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,280
Billy Baraka
a mercenary from Angola.

141
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,315
Grew up fighting for freedom
in the civil war

142
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,818
before fighting for cash
in the Congo.

143
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,522
Teamed up with Rob
20 years ago.

144
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,157
And they've had each others
backs every fucking since.

145
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,561
Danny Oswald, ex-SAS.

146
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,696
Served his time in the sandbox,
before going into

147
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,067
the private sector and putting
his skills to better use.

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,701
Namely, profit.

149
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,806
He met Rob
in a South African jail.

150
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,141
Been thick as thieves
for ten years now.

151
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:38,111


152
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,149
These were
The Three Musketeers.

153
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,951
"All for one, one for all."

154
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,521
And anyone that fucked with
them, came a cropper.

155
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,090
Think it over.

156
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,126
Danny, I want to know
everything about her.

157
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,596
Certainly know
how to choose 'em, mate.

158
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,731
Choice has nothing
to do with it.

159
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,703
Hi, there.

160
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,105
Can I help you, darling?

161
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,339
I'm looking for someone.

162
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,907
Aren't we all?

163
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,543
Aunt Nellie,
smartest woman I know.

164
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,178
Mid-twenties, blonde hair,
blue eyes.

165
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,581
That'll be Scarlett.

166
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,549
She's over there
in the ring, love.

167
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,917
And you must be Aunt Nellie,
with the right hook?

168
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,920
Back in the day, love.
Back in the day.

169
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,455
It's a nice place you got here.

170
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,424
Some women buy hair salons

171
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,959
I bought this place.

172
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,528
It's got character.

173
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,364
I've got character.
This place has rats.

174
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,102
Scarlett, there's a young fellow
over here looking for you.

175
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,746
Jesus, young one.
How many times.

176
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,282
Keep your fucking guard up.

177
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,392
How the hell did you find me?

178
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,694
- I asked around.
- That's a bit stalkery.

179
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,397
No, stalking would be
unwanted attention.

180
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,032
Boyfriend, remember?

181
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,368
You're still flogging that shit?

182
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,905

183
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,343
We, uh, we haven't been
properly introduced.

184
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm Robert. Friends call me Rob.

185
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,081
Scarlett.

186
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,284
Like Scarlett O'Hara?

187
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,852
My mum said I was born stubborn.

188
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,220

189
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,925
When are you going to learn
to stay down, girl?

190
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,426
Never.

191
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,264
- Where you from?
- The US originally.

192
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,999
But, uh, work keeps me overseas.

193
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,535
Oh, yeah,
what work is that then?

194
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:42,936
Supply and demand.

195
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,771
Based out of the Canaries,
but, uh

196
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,040
most of our product
comes from Africa.

197
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,643
- You've ever been there?
- Never been anywhere.

198
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,477
Oh, Africa is beautiful.

199
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,413
But she'll challenge you
every step of the way.

200
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,648
You like a challenge then?

201
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,815
If it ain't worth a fight

202
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,183
it ain't worth having.

203
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,918
You sound like gangster.

204
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,855

205
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,594
Do your worst.

206
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,562
I can go all day.

207
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,763

Keep 'em coming.

208
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,800
So what about you,
what's your game?

209
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,373
Never let them see me coming.

210
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,980
Not bad
for a skinny English girl.

211
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,448


212
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,019
So what about Friday night?

213
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,787

214
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,725
I told you, I can't.

215
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,826
What's the story with you two,
anyway?

216
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,528
I was going through some shit
and he helped me out.

217
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:44,764
- So you feel like you owe him.
- Yeah, something like that.

218
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,399
He's holding you back.

219
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,536
Look, I appreciate the effort,
mate.

220
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,672
But you're barking up
the wrong tree.

221
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,339
Will I see you again?

222
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,075
What do my eyes tell you?

223
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,947
Don't get me wrong,
I was fucking tempted.

224
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,849
But I ain't the kinda girl
who drops her knickers

225
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,685
'cause some bloke gives her
the time of day.

226
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,688
Time to pay a visit to the one
man I could always rely on.

227
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,489


228
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,993
You alright, lil' bro?

229
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,399
Hey, Dave,
have you got any crisps?

230
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,034
Uh, bottom cupboard.

231
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,169
And get me a beer,
I'm dryer than a nun's chuff.

232
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,872
Dave, my brother
from the same mother.

233
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,308
Loves a curry, cheats at cards.

234
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,711

235
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,312
Cheers.

236
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,590
I met a gangster today.

237
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:45,491

Oh, yeah. Al Capone was it?

238
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,293
I'm serious, you nob.

239
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,861
A proper fucking gangster.

240
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,496
He's desperate to get
in my knickers.

241
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,266
Oh, too much information.

242
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,768
Do you fancy him?

243
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,537
- I don't know.
- Of course you fucking do.

244
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,338
You want to be picking pockets
for that prick all your life?

245
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,239
No fucking way.

246
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,945 Just ain't used to
someone being, you know...nice

247
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,280
Makes me nervous.

248
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,749
You ain't afraid of nothing.

249
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,051
Just don't end up like mum
is all I'm saying.

250
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,659
Well...I think I missed
my chance now.

251
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,894
There's no point
stressing about it.

252
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,199
Alright, then, giz a go.

253
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,369
Alright, keep going up there.

254
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,436
That's it.

255
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,405

Oh, yeah.

256
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,007
Nice one. That's gotta hurt.

257
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,512
Michelle, you ready?

258
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,046


259
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,549
- Babe, what's wrong?
- I feel like shit.

260
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,050
I think I'm coming down
with something.

261
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,451
Oh, fuck.
You should take the night off.

262
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,687
You're in no state to go out.

263
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,254
I can't, he'll go mental.

264
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,590
- You know what he's like.
- Well, fuck him.

265
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,791
You're his best earner, but you

266
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,425
ain't good to him like this.

267
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,328
Be an angel will you
and bring some chicken soup.

268
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,598
Of course, babe.
I'll see you later.

269
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,932
- Careful.
- Always.

270
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,514
Alright, I'm off out.

271
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,616
Well, stay out of bother.

272
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,984
And bring me back
something nice.

273
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,521
Yeah, whatever.

274
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,758
So there I was.
Back to the same old routine.

275
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,593
But I couldn't get him
out of my head.

276
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,832
Maybe if I hadn't been so
stubborn, so messed up.

277
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,767
Or maybe I won't get
a chance like that again.

278
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,268
It didn't matter.

279
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,805
If nothing else, it inspired me
to make a change

280
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,273
and take back control
of my life.

281
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,878
(Adam)
'What you think this is,'

282
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,145
'the fucking Ritz?'

283
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,481
'Get to fucking work,
or get back on the streets'

284
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,116
'where I found you.'

285
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,218
You lazy bitch.

286
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,020
What the fuck.

287
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,723
Fuck! Adam, stop. Stop!

288
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,692
Fuck!

289
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,527


290
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,329
Adam, you're going to
fucking kill her.

291
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,298
Adam! Argh!

292
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,639


293
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,043
Yeah.

294
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,514
Okay.

295
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:23,951
- Rob.
- Huh?

296
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,752
I don't know if you give a shit,
but...

297
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,487
But what?

298
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,156
You wanted to know everything
about the girl, right?

299
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,628
Scarlett Monaghan.

300
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:36,462
- There.
- Thank you.

301
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,467
Hey.

302
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,239
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

303
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,708
I did.

304
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,744
Doc, how's she doing?

305
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,479
Two cracked ribs,
multiple cuts and bruises

306
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,081
mainly to her own hands.

307
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,617
She put up a good fight.

308
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,619
But she won't say with who.

309
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,219
Maybe she'll tell you.

310
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,659
I already know.

311
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,226
Listen to me.

312
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,998
You're never going back there.

313
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,566
Where am I gonna go?

314
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,267
I can't go to Dave's,
if he sees me like this

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,836
he'll break Adam's fucking neck.

316
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,504
You care about that
piece of shit?

317
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,006
No, I don't want my brother
to go to jail.

318
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,574
Nobody's going to jail.

319
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,510
Now, you gotta trust me.

320
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:24,811
All my stuff's there and--

321
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,445
Forget it.
Forget about your stuff.

322
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,214
- We'll get you new stuff.
- What about Michelle?

323
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,083
He'll never lay another finger
on her or anyone else.

324
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,854
I guarantee it.

325
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,321


326
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,423
Yo, babe.

327
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,696
- Cooey.
- Who the fuck are youse?

328
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,398


329
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,070


330
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,739
♪ Hey hey hey ♪♪♪

331
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,173
Now...

332
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,543
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do

333
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,077
about you, aren't we?

334
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,414

335
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,419
- Argh. Fuck.
- Shit. You okay?

336
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,854
Yeah, don't stop.

337
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,489


338
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,628

339
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,464


340
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,826
Don't worry.
I don't charge by the hour.

341
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,695
What? Oh, fuck, no.

342
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,497

343
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,233
My older brother Jack
gave it to me for my 18th.

344
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,905
Two weeks later
he was shot dead in the street.

345
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,675
I was standing next to him
when it happened.

346
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,410
The only reason I'm alive
is 'cause he pushed me clear.

347
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,412
That's how it got broken.

348
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,751
- You've worn it ever since?
- Yeah.

349
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,620
Reminds me of Jack
and what he did.

350
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,592
Old habits die hard.

351
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,227
We all have shit in our pasts.

352
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,697
Mum called it fertilizer.

353
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,065
Says it helps us grow.

354
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,833
Your mom sounds
like a smart lady.

355
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,769
The best.

356
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,004
Except when it come to men.

357
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,606
Your old man?

358
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,874
He was a drunk.

359
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,944
Just angry all the time.

360
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,613
He would come home from the pub.

361
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:43,617
Face like a beetroot,
stinking of beer and fags.

362
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,386
Then he'd beat
the shit out of her.

363
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,423
Me and my brother Dave
used to hide in my room.

364
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:54,193
We'd still hear the yelling
and screaming from downstairs.

365
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,899
Sometimes when I go to sleep
I can still hear it.

366
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
Piece of shit.

367
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,037
Where is he now?

368
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,839
He's rotting in jail
where he belongs.

369
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,745
A few years back,
he shot a security guard

370
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,947
on a botched robbery.
Got 20 years for that.

371
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,583
What a fuck up.

372
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,421
You're the first person
I've ever told that to.

373
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,293
I have to pee,
then you can fuck me again.

374
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,430


375
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,304

376
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,875
Days came and went,
bruises healed

377
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,011
and me and Rob
got closer and closer.

378
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,148
Anyone who's ever been in love,
will know exactly

379
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,183
what I'm talking about.

380
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,619
It's the best drug there is.

381
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,922
And I was high
as a fucking kite.

382
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,358

383
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,150


384
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,651
You know what I mean?

385
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,556
I'm sorry,
they're my best friends.

386
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,726


387
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,030


388
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,464
Move!

389
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,001


390
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,570
Robert.

391
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,139
Move back.

392
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,607
On me.

393
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,810

Move back.

394
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,311
Stay behind me.
Stay behind me. Danny!

395
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,214

Move, mate. Move

396
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,816
Baraka!

397
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:02,022


398
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,561
Move, move. Shit!

399
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,662
Get in.

400
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,996

401
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,464


402
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:19,172


403
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:21,440


404
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,777


405
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,079


406
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,087


407
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,758


408
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,001


409
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,139


410
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,610


411
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,150


412
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,833


413
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,410
And that's when I saw him
for the first time.

414
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,946
The real Rob.

415
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,147
The man who'd die for me,

416
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,249
the man who'd kill for me.

417
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,886
Not a word of a lie.
It really turned me on.

418
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,788


419
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,792
- For fuck sake, Rob
- You guys okay?

420
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:46,993
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,460
Danny, help me with this guy.

422
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,096
- We're gonna use their car.
- Alright.

423
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,598
Baraka, you take Scarlett
upstairs.

424
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,266
- Okay.
- No. no. I don't want to go.

425
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,467
Hey, hey, look,
you're gonna be fine

426
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,271
you go with Baraka
while I clean up this mess okay?

427
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,907
Look, you take this.

428
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,509
Look at me.

429
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,578
Hey, hey. I'm sorry.

430
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,747
I never meant to put you
in any danger.

431
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,116
If you're not here
when I get back...

432
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,791
I'll guard her with my life.

433
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,629
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,331
So do you reckon Charlie's boys?

435
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,866
No, this is too fucked up
even for Charlie.

436
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,736
So what's the plan?

437
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,038
The plan is,
we stick to the plan

438
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:34,107
and get the fuck out of town.

439
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,809


440
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,744


441
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,220

442
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,657
Baraka!

443
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,727
I sent him home.

444
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,328


445
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:57,597
You actually stayed.

446
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,833
You know I'm no
shrinking violet.

447
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,470
Like I know you
fly close to the wind.

448
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,672
That's part of the attraction
though, right?

449
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,008
Yeah.

450
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,881
Here, I kept it safe for you.

451
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,051
- You hurt yourself.
- It's alright.

452
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,619
No, let me take a look at that.

453
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,223
Deep breath.

454
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,027
Alright, hey, whoa, whoa.

455
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,294
Oh, my God.

456
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:30,497
You handled yourself
well tonight.

457
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,699
But the real test comes
when you run out of bullets.

458
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,300
I've been in a few fights.

459
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,703
No, I'm not talking about
the boxing ring.

460
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,705
I'm talking about a fight
till the death.

461
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,473
Where anything within reach
is a weapon,

462
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:41,908
you'll do whatever it takes
to stay alive.

463
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,744
That's when you find out
who you really are.

464
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,515
Here you go.

465
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,883
So why don't you tell me
who you really are.

466
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,952
Who those men were, who were
trying to kill us tonight.

467
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,188
Oh, not us, just me.

468
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,893
For this.

469
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,499
Is that what I think it is?

470
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:09,669
168 carats of it.

471
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:13,406
And I thought you peddled dope.

472
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,109
Did once, stole a few cars.

473
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,944
Did a little gun running.

474
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,879
Now I deal in diamonds.

475
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:25,118
The most important thing to know
about the diamond trade

476
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,887
is that it's dirty and corrupt.

477
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,191
Everybody's out to fuck you.

478
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,926
Now, all you can do
is have a code.

479
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,029
Me, I won't knowingly deal
in conflict diamonds.

480
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,164
But it's impossible to keep 'em
out of the mix.

481
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,467
You think your jeweler
on Bond Street or Fifth Avenue

482
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,268
really knows
where their rocks come from?

483
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:45,772
No. Truth is
they don't wanna know.

484
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,242
Now, 65% of the world's diamonds
comes from Africa.

485
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,545
This one here...

486
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,514
...was probably dug up
by some poor bastard

487
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,982
slogging his guts out
in a ditch somewhere.

488
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,486
Now, he finds it and he knows
it's worth a fortune.

489
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,388
What's he gonna do?
Fly to Antwerp?

490
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:05,658
No. So he takes
a big fucking risk

491
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,328
shoves it up his ass
and he smuggles it out

492
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,598
past the guards with machetes.

493
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,165
Then he sells it on
to someone local

494
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,633
for a few hundred bucks.

495
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,135
And then that guy marks it up
and sells it on

496
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,103
and so on and so on,
until it gets into the hands

497
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,006
of a local warlord,
now that's where I come in.

498
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,110
I deal with
the regional chiefs direct.

499
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,846
And they are very shrewd
when it comes to business.

500
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,182
You fuck with these guys
and they chop you into fish bait

501
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,950
and feed you to the crocodiles.

502
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,753
The rocks that I purchase
then go to Mumbai

503
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:36,055
where they get cut and graded.

504
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,359
And from there I sell
to my clients in the UK, China,

505
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,028
Russia and the biggest client
of all...

506
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,863
good ol' US of A.

507
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,032
Where those rocks ends up
adorning the fingers and necks

508
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,802
of movie stars, rap artists
and even a few royals.

509
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,338
- That's pretty fucking cool.
- Yeah.

510
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:53,873
It gets cooler.

511
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,241


512
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,710
I picked up this rock
for 500,000.

513
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,381
Within 24 hours
I got a call from Charlie.

514
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,916
Who's that?

515
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,221
Charlie is, uh...a legend
in the diamond trade.

516
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,758
She drinks with drug lords
and dines with ex-presidents.

517
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,627
- She?
- That's right.

518
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,962
She can place a stone
with any buyer in the world

519
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,765
from Saudi Princes
to Yakuza bosses.

520
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,134
And she wants this rock.

521
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,170
And she's made me an offer
that's well...

522
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,105
...it's hard to refuse.

523
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,941
How much?

524
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,611
15 mill.

525
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,580
And this is just a sample.

526
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,881
Charlie wants a regular supply.

527
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:38,952
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

528
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,387
This is the deal
that changes everything.

529
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,457
This is the deal
that gets us out.

530
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,126
So what happens now?

531
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,395
Well, now,
we do the trade with Charlie.

532
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:51,764
You wanna come?

533
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,200
- What can I do?
- Well, you could...

534
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:56,936
Watch my back.

535
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,805
Just make sure
you wear something, uh,

536
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,807
attention grabbing.

537
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,543
You want me to be a distraction?

538
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,477
No, no. I want you to look hot.

539
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:06,779
Mm, I'll give it a shot.

540
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,748
Hand-off's in 19 hours.

541
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,085
So until then we gotta sit
tight, keep this safe.

542
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,355
Well, I could think of a few
things to pass the time.

543
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:18,157
Scrabble and shit.

544
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,233


545
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,816
Not what I expected from
an international crime queen.

546
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,285
What is this place?

547
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,920
When she's not peddling
million dollar diamonds

548
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,658
Charlie runs a side hustle
in fine arts,

549
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,026
strictly for the wealthiest
of clientele.

550
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,294
Cushty.

551
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,198
Wow! Blimey!

552
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:02,835
This ain't too shabby.

553
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:07,173
More carats in here
than Sainsbury's.

554
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,877
And just, uh, be sure to keep
your fingers to yourself, okay?

555
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,446
Best behavior, cross my heart.

556
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,981
I'll let Victor know we're here.

557
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,282
Thanks.

558
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,018
Let's grab a drink.

559
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,421


560
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,292
- Robert.
- Hmm.

561
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,895
Welcome.

562
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,863
And you must be Scarlett.

563
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,833
Yeah. Word travels fast.

564
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,168
Scarlett, this is Victor.

565
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,571
Charlie's second cousin,
twice removed.

566
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:39,172
Ah, family business, yeah?

567
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:42,842
We keep our friends close
and our family closer.

568
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:46,346
Victor Resnick, ex-enforcer
for the Russian mob.

569
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:47,548
Now, he works for Charlie.

570
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,315
What about your enemies?

571
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,353
We have no enemies.
Please follow me.

572
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,595
Okay. Never forget.

573
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,065
Wait. Come.

574
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,235
Now, what do we have here?

575
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,505
Hmm. A big boy, yeah.

576
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:15,274
Easy boys. Any closer I'll have
to charge.

577
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:18,945
Hey, Charlie.

578
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,913
Charlie, looks like royalty,

579
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,382
swears like a docker.

580
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:24,450
Gentlemen, Scarlett.

581
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:26,319
Please, come on in.

582
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,622
Does everyone here know my name?

583
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:31,759
Scarlett Monaghan,
born in Peckham, 1995.

584
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:35,161
Nobody gets through these doors
that I don't know.

585
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:38,832
There were armed,
but, uh, nothing else.

586
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:43,169
Oh, my.
That's a big shiv, Baraka.

587
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,675
Planning on taking scalps?

588
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,312
Never know which way
the night is gonna go.

589
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:56,416
You are so right.

590
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,654
It seems we have some
trust issues to deal with.

591
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,524
So, ladies, skedaddle.

592
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:05,057
Go on.

593
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,863
If I am going into business
with someone

594
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:13,032
I like to know
who the fuck they are.

595
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,870
And the best way is to ask
who they fuck.

596
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,472
He doesn't need to wave a gun
in my face to get my attention

597
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:20,574
if that's what you mean.

598
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,341


599
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:27,980
Oh, I like this girl, Rob.
She's a keeper.

600
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,988
Do you trust him?

601
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:37,658
Yes, I do.

602
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,258
That's good.

603
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:42,428
Trust is very hard to find
these days.

604
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:45,097
And he respects me.

605
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,433
Sweet.

606
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,839
You see these ugly bastards?

607
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,608
There's not one of them
wouldn't take a bullet for me

608
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,342
some of them already have.

609
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,977
You know why?

610
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,714
'Cause these men are beasts.

611
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03,684
Beasts respect one thing...

612
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,652
natural authority.

613
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:09,690
And you either have it,
or you don't.

614
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,390
Isn't that right, Rob?

615
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:16,964
That's been my experience,
yeah.

616
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,933
Why don't we all
calm the fuck down

617
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,736
and get on
with the business at hand?

618
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:29,041
It is time for the floor show.

619
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,320
Do you know this man, Scarlett?

620
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,357
- No, I don't.
- You certain?

621
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,697
You know a woman can always tell
if another woman is lying.

622
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:55,468
And if you are, I'll get
one of my boys to, uh,

623
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:57,871
drag you into the bathroom
and cut out your uterus

624
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,706
with a rusty knife.

625
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,240
- Still don't know him.
- Good.

626
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,677
Because this piece of shit...

627
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,046
...tried to steal
from my business partner.

628
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,483
Which is the same
as stealing from me.

629
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:14,688
And there's one thing
I can't abide is cuntery.

630
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:21,628
If you're squeamish,
look away now.

631
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,300
Victor!

632
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:30,269


633
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:34,240


634
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,345
Now, I learnt this...

635
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,516
...from a boyfriend...

636
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:47,754
...in...Bogotá.

637
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,360
- You alright?
- Didn't spill a drop.

638
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,740
'Hmm.'

639
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:09,543
You know...

640
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:13,312
...I could fetch
a couple of mill for that.

641
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:17,084
I can't say I'm not disappointed

642
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,385
you turning up empty handed.

643
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,122
Where the fuck
is my merchandise?

644
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:27,861
Scarlett, I think Charlie looks
like she could use a drink.

645
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,767


646
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,602
Well, fuck me sideways.

647
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:37,370


648
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,641
Oh!

649
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:43,810


650
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:47,179
You are beautiful.

651
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,449
Victor, pay the man.

652
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,727
Alright, take it.
I'll meet you out front.

653
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,539
Charlie, it is a pleasure
doing business with you.

654
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,610
One more thing before you go.

655
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:22,015
Now, that we're partners we're
more than friends, we're family.

656
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:25,552
Together we drink the blood
of our enemies.

657
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,758
Don't make a cunt out of me.

658
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,293
Here's to the first of many.

659
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:35,595
Budmo!

660
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,968
Fuck me, that was intense.

661
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,270
- What do you make of Charlie?
- She's off her fucking tits.

662
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,672
But I reckon
she's a straight shooter.

663
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,239
And you know this how?

664
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,575
Because I'm an excellent judge
of character.

665
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,443
Then why are you
with a crook like me?

666
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,012
'Cause you make me wetter
than an otter's pocket.

667
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,680
You know if I can't deliver,
it's my ass.

668
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,682
Pity, it's such a nice ass.

669
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,654

670
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,291
Nicely done. Duchess.

671
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,226
Why, did you just call her
Duchess?

672
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,831
Yeah. She handled that shit
with grace.

673
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:12,398
Like a Duchess.

674
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:14,333
Oh, why didn't you call her
a fucking, like

675
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:15,669
princess or something?

676
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:17,971
No. Duchess is better.

677
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,173
I like that.

678
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,542
Problem solved.

679
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:23,744
Stupid.

680
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:24,845


681
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:26,513


682
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:29,916
(Aunt Nellie)
'You should see him'

683
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,751
'before you go.'

684
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:31,918

'Fuck that.'

685
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:33,385
You can't be afraid of him

686
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,089
your whole fucking life.

687
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:39,092
Look, what used to I say to you

688
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:41,695
when you were close
to giving up a fight?

689
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:44,463
Forget the pain
and get back in the ring.

690
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:45,932
Right.

691
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:48,769
Because the pain goes away.

692
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:52,973
But the choices you make
stay with you forever.

693
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:57,744
You've never backed down
from a fight in your life.

694
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:59,411


695
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,356
'Well, look what'

696
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,424
'the cat dragged in.'

697
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:19,800
I see the girl I once knew
in the woman before me.

698
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:21,835


699
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,305
Well...

700
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,642
Nine years
and you have nothing to say?

701
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,847
Oh, cheers.

702
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:36,750
Don't thank me.

703
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:39,052
It speaks.

704
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,589
Those things will kill you.

705
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:44,024
Hmm.

706
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,126


707
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:47,794
You should be so lucky.

708
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,267
What the fuck
did mum ever see in you?

709
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,402
I had my moments.

710
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,338
Still do from time to time.

711
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:01,208
Jesus.

712
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:05,512
Do you feel anything
about what you did?

713
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:07,814
Doesn't pay
to dwell in the past in here.

714
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:12,484
No, down that road
they say lies madness.

715
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:15,722
What's done is done,
can't be undone.

716
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,204
I'm leaving.

717
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,640
Getting away from this place.
Away from you.

718
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,410
I just didn't want to go without
looking you in the eyes

719
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:41,380
one last time, to see if there's
a soul in there.

720
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:42,949
Well, what do you see?

721
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,086
Nothing worth saving.

722
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:51,224
You know you can choose
where you're going

723
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,093
but you can't change
where you came from.

724
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,730
You have my blood flowing
through your veins.

725
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,366
That means you're my girl
and you always will be.

726
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,801
- I ain't your fucking girl.
- Ah!

727
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,870
Yet here you are.

728
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,404
Looking for what?

729
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,875
Acceptance, absolution?

730
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,410
Closure, hmm?

731
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:13,313

You know, you can have

732
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,316
the lot of it, if you want
if it makes you feel better.

733
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:21,254
But don't come in here,
looking to save my soul.

734
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:23,823
Because I am beyond redemption.

735
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:31,331
I've been rotten to the core
since the day I was born.

736
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,600
Your mother knew that.
She stayed anyway.

737
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:35,669
No, she stayed out of fear

738
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,304
not love

739
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,705


740
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,908
Let me give you
some fatherly advice.

741
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:46,246
Stop looking for it to make
sense, because it never will.

742
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:47,714
Hmm?

743
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,450
If I could do it all again,
would I do things differently?

744
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:54,421

I'd still be the same old Frank.

745
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,723
Making the same old choices.

746
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:01,995
You know, I've long since come
to accept who I am.

747
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,331
Maybe it's time you did too.

748
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,999
Fucking hell.

749
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,835
To think I actually came here
to give you a chance.

750
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,403
Don't kid yourself.

751
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,706
You came here
to look in the mirror.

752
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,774
You just don't like
what you see.

753
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,244
You're wrong.

754
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:20,013
I ain't nothing like you.

755
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:22,716
I'm fucking ashamed
you're my father.

756
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:27,087
Uh-huh. But like it or not,
I am your father.

757
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:36,763
If you come near us,
ever again...

758
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:39,899
I will fucking kill you.

759
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:42,969
Ooh.

760
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,271
Hmm.

761
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,541
That's my girl.

762
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:53,513


763
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,283

Remember how I said,

764
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,451
this man would change my life?

765
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,186
Check this out.

766
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,526
I know what you're gonna say.

767
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:09,396
He's into some shady shit,
but I didn't care.

768
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:11,464
If I wasn't willing
to risk it all for love

769
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:13,533
then what's the point?

770
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,804


771
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,101
Welcome to your new home.

772
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,303
Fuck me.

773
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,138

Come on.

774
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:56,109
Oh, my God.

775
00:42:57,844 --> 00:42:58,878
Well...

776
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,047
...what do you think?

777
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:02,248
Fucking love it.

778
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,117
Come on. Come on.

779
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:07,087
Wow.

780
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,855


781
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,994

782
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,913
It was like coming home
for the first time.

783
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,349
And the whole gang was there
to welcome us.

784
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:38,618
Well. Santiago, Tom.

785
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,354
Santiago, this is Scarlett.

786
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,456
- Scarlett, Santiago.
- Hello, pretty.

787
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,594
There was Santiago,
Rob's local partner.

788
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:48,529
All chest hair
and too much cologne.

789
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:50,230
He started out smuggling drugs
for one of

790
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:51,664
the Galician cartels
in Spain.

791
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,466
Until Rob recruited him
alongside

792
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,435
his halfwit
younger brother Marco.

793
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,105
Well, the less said about him
the better.

794
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,473
- Johannes.
- Howzit.

795
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:01,674
The walking grease ball was

796
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,409
Johannes from South Africa

797
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,411
Santiago's hired gun
and definitely

798
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:07,080
a few sandwiches
short of a picnic.

799
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:08,481
And last but not least.

800
00:44:08,616 --> 00:44:10,950
And my oldest
and dearest friend.

801
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:12,418
Tom Sullivan.

802
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,556
Tom, this is Scarlett.

803
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:17,857
Rob may have mentioned you
a few hundred times.

804
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,493
Sounds like I got a bit of
catching up to do.

805
00:44:20,628 --> 00:44:22,630
I know all of his deepest,
darkest secrets.

806
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:24,532
Enough tequila, you might
just get it out of me.

807
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:26,666
Fuck you, Tom.

808
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:29,169
Scarlett, welcome.

809
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,772
To Casa Bling.

810
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:34,474
Santiago, what's, uh, what's
with the welcome committee?

811
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:35,975
It's not really your style,
is it?

812
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,278
We heard about
what happened in London.

813
00:44:38,411 --> 00:44:40,313
We are a little concerned.

814
00:44:40,446 --> 00:44:42,448
Huh? I got to talk to the guys.

815
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,950
Why don't you settle in?

816
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,653
Maria will take care of
anything you need, okay?

817
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:47,253
- Hola, señora.
- See you in a bit?

818
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:48,955
- Yeah.
- Would you like a drink?

819
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:51,324
Me and you
are gonna be best mates.

820
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:52,959
Let's talk.

821
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:58,097
Look, whatever shit went down,
we delivered the merch

822
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,832
and Charlie's happy.

823
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,235
Let's just make sure it stays
that way.

824
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,705
Do you think it was
a rival crew?

825
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:07,740
They knew the exact time
and place.

826
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:11,377
Had to be an inside job.

827
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:21,154
Rob, you're still with us?

828
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:24,290
- This is fucking serious.
- Yeah, no shit, Santiago.

829
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:25,825
What's the word on the street?

830
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:28,228
We talked to
all of our usual sources.

831
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,697
Nobody knows shit.

832
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,731
Or they are too afraid to talk.

833
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:33,433
Then we make 'em talk.

834
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,836
Whoever is fucking with us
is already dead.

835
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,371
They just don't know it yet.

836
00:45:38,805 --> 00:45:40,473

837
00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:42,208
In England
there's a class system.

838
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,310
Where you're born,
which school you go to

839
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:46,079
how to pronounce
your fucking Ts.

840
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,314
It's been like that
for a thousand fucking years.

841
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:49,849
And it ain't about to change.

842
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:52,553
But down here
no one gives a monkey's.

843
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,787
The only rule
is survival of the fittest.

844
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:58,124
And that's a rule
I can relate to.

00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:50,517
They got us boxed in.

914
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,218
Who the fuck are these guys?

915
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:53,787


916
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:55,989
How do we get out of this one,
Butch?

917
00:50:56,122 --> 00:50:57,423
This is how.

918
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,760
Come here. Get behind me.
Come here.

919
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:01,494
[explosion]

920
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:03,564


921
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:06,833
Go get the truck!

922
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,569


923
00:51:11,505 --> 00:51:13,472


924
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,579
Let's go! Let's go!

925
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:20,547


926
00:51:27,654 --> 00:51:29,388


927
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:43,670
Hey, there.

928
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:55,649
No!

929
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,587
Why don't you
just give me what I want?

930
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,623


931
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,091
Hey!

932
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,794


933
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,129


934
00:52:10,262 --> 00:52:11,832
Do you like to play rough?

935
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:14,568
- You little English bitch.
- Get the fuck out of my house.

936
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,837
Sorry. Can't do that.

937
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,171
Maria, get behind me.

938
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,974


939
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,844
What? You think
I came here for her?

940
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:28,147


941
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:32,586


942
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,155


943
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,391

944
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,669


945
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:56,409


946
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:03,750
What can I tell you?

947
00:53:03,884 --> 00:53:05,351
It was him or me.

948
00:53:05,484 --> 00:53:07,954
But looking at him laying there
bleeding on the floor

949
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:09,723
I didn't feel a fucking thing.

950
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:11,925
Maybe I was more like
me old man than I thought.

951
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,360
But I also knew
I rocked the boat big time.

952
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,429
And I didn't know
how Rob would take it.

953
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:19,331
Oh, fuck.

954
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:22,602
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

955
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:23,870
You alright?

956
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:28,307
Yeah, yeah, Rob.

957
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,678
Little bit of an issue.

958
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,614
You okay?

959
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:37,851


960
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:44,758
Thank you, Duchess.

961
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:48,494
Come here.

962
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:01,307
Where's Scarlett?

963
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,276
- She's upstairs, mate.
- Shit!

964
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,213
Get rid of that.
Baraka, give him a hand.

965
00:54:06,345 --> 00:54:07,681
I'll go get a rope.

966
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:12,853
Maria, hey.

967
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,254
It's not safe for you here.
Okay?

968
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:24,030
You take this.

969
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:25,899
You never come back.
You understand?

970
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,703
- You understand?
- Gracias, Senor Robert.

971
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:35,609

972
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:37,376
No, no. Oh.

973
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:40,547
For fuck sake.

974
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:42,481
(Rob)'Scarlett!'

975
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:44,951
Scarlett!

976
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:50,791
Are you hurt?

977
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:54,360
I'm alright.

978
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:57,998
Fuck.

979
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:02,536
Talk to me.

980
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,039
What the fuck!

981
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,845
Rob, talk to me.

982
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:14,480


983
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:19,820
Please.

984
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:30,730
I could've lost you.

985
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:33,465


986
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:37,938


987
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:39,806
One, two, three.

988
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,442
Come and get it.

989
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:44,911


990
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:48,748
Oh.

991
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:50,382


992
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,653


993
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:56,623
- Yeah.
- Marco's dead.

994
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,490
- What the fuck happened?
- Look, it doesn't matter.

995
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,193
He was a fucking pig
and he got what he deserved.

996
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:01,360
'Alright, Rob,
I need you to listen to me.'

997
00:56:01,493 --> 00:56:02,796
He came to my fucking house,

998
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,831
he came after Scarlett.
He crossed a line.

999
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:07,366
This was Jack's problem,
he never listened.

1000
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:09,368
Alright, I'm listening.

1001
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,672
Marco was a piece of shit,
but blood is blood, Rob

1002
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,708
and Santiago isn't just gonna
let this go.

1003
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:17,043
Well, at least we know who's
trying to fuck us now, right?

1004
00:56:17,177 --> 00:56:19,279
For now, I just need you
and Scarlett

1005
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:21,781
to get to a safe house
and lay low.

1006
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:22,916
'What about you?'

1007
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,383
Santiago is a business man

1008
00:56:24,517 --> 00:56:25,986
I'm gonna try to appeal
to his sense of greed.

1009
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,221
If not?

1010
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:31,558
Then you my friend
are gonna do what you do best

1011
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:33,660
kill the son of a bitch.

1012
00:56:35,695 --> 00:56:37,097
- You got everything?
- I think so.

1013
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,497
Let's go grab that one.

1014
00:56:38,632 --> 00:56:40,499
- Rob, meet us out front.
- Yeah.

1015
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:42,335
Okay. Come on, guys,
let's go.

1016
00:56:42,468 --> 00:56:44,137
Come on, baby.

1017
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:45,939
Come on.

1018
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:47,507
- Thanks, Danny.
- Come on.

1019
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:49,743
- Thank you.
- Come on, come on.

1020
00:56:51,978 --> 00:56:53,479


1021
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:56,883

Going somewhere?

1022
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,887


1023
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:17,037
Santiago.

1024
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:19,839
You piece of shit.

1025
00:57:19,973 --> 00:57:22,441
Why don't you just
make yourself at home, huh?

1026
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,544
There is an old saying, Rob.

1027
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:28,148
That seems pertinent
to this occasion.

1028
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:32,185
Never invite
a vampire into your house

1029
00:57:32,484 --> 00:57:34,220
it renders you powerless.

1030
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:36,156
Well, this is all about blood

1031
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:38,091
do you mind if
I just have one last drink?

1032
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:39,893
- Be my guest.
- You wanna join me?

1033
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:41,127
Fuck you.

1034
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:42,595


1035
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:56,509
We always said,
business comes first.

1036
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,445
No matter what.

1037
00:57:58,578 --> 00:58:02,549
But this just got very personal.

1038
00:58:03,482 --> 00:58:04,918
You know...

1039
00:58:07,454 --> 00:58:09,756
I always knew that someday,
someone would step up

1040
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:12,192
to challenge me.

1041
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:14,294
I just hoped
that when that day came

1042
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:17,130
they'd have the balls
to look me in the eye

1043
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:20,367
and not stab me in the back.

1044
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:21,901
He was my brother, Rob.

1045
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:24,771
You of all people
should understand that.

1046
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:29,709
But... I'm a reasonable man.

1047
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:34,180
Business first, right?

1048
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:39,552
So you want
the Charlie deal to go through?

1049
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:42,822
And I want my pound of flesh.

1050
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,158
Hey, hey.

1051
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,060
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, okay?

1052
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:50,463
You can't threaten me anymore,
Rob.

1053
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,533
There was a time when nobody
would fuck with you.

1054
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,269
You had the world by the balls.

1055
00:58:56,403 --> 00:58:58,371
[blows]
And you let it go.

1056
00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:01,307
Is that what this is about?

1057
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:02,942
You want the old Rob back?

1058
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:05,211

You know, you should be

1059
00:59:05,345 --> 00:59:06,479
careful what you wish for.

1060
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:08,248


1061
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,619
The old Rob may have been crazy,

1062
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:15,255
but at least
I could respect him.

1063
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:17,957
This new Rob,
all talking and no...

1064
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:19,292


1065
00:59:19,426 --> 00:59:20,827
Run!

1066
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:24,964


1067
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:26,332
Run!

1068
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:29,202
No!

1069
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,706

1070
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,144
You really should put that girl
on a chain.

1071
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:39,913
She's out of control.

1072
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:43,049
What did I say, Rob?

1073
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:44,350
You never fucking listen.

1074
00:59:44,484 --> 00:59:45,819
Now, it's too late.

1075
00:59:45,952 --> 00:59:47,087

1076
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,389
No. No, you fucker.

1077
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:51,958
- Rob.
- Fuck, that was uncalled for.

1078
00:59:57,931 --> 00:59:59,732
How long have we know
each other?

1079
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:04,037
How long has it taken us
to build this?

1080
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:06,372
20 fucking years.

1081
01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:10,578
But where has your old pal Tom
been all that time?

1082
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,580
Right by your side.

1083
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,348
Always the bridesmaid,
never the fucking bride, huh?

1084
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:16,816
Fuck you.

1085
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:20,019
I've sacrificed way too much
to stand by and watch you

1086
01:00:20,153 --> 01:00:22,388
piss it all away
for a fucking skirt.

1087
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:25,058
I will not let that happen.

1088
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:28,562
For the record.

1089
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:31,364
It was Santiago
who told Marco to kill Scarlett.

1090
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,001
I thought it was a bad move.

1091
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,903
Seems I was right.

1092
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,139
As for you...

1093
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,708
...that's on me.

1094
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:44,177
You piece of shit. You're dead.

1095
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,278

1096
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,348
No, Rob, you are.

1097
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:50,216

1098
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,118
Just like your no good brother.

1099
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,021
I'm gonna fucking
tear your heart out.

1100
01:00:58,057 --> 01:00:59,292


1101
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,195
- Get 'em out of here.
- No.

1102
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:04,297

1103
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:16,476
Baraka, the loyal dog.

1104
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,778
Faithful to the end.

1105
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:25,718
Better a dog, than a rat.

1106
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:30,223
You know power
commands treachery.

1107
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:33,226
Otherwise it stagnates.

1108
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:34,727
You know, sooner or later
someone's gonna try

1109
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,462
to take it away from me.

1110
01:01:36,597 --> 01:01:40,233
I just hope, I don't get screwed
over for something as stupid

1111
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:41,734
as love.

1112
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:44,704
See, Rob loves his bitch,
you love your friend.

1113
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:47,240
Look where it's gotten you.

1114
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:53,780
Now, I've heard
you like to feed the animals.

1115
01:01:57,518 --> 01:01:59,385
So why don't you go
feed the animals.

1116
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:13,634

1117
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,603


1118
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,838
Your choice, bro. Dead or alive?

1119
01:02:18,972 --> 01:02:22,008
You talk too much,
get it over with.

1120
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:24,844
Why waste a good bullet
on a piece of shit like you.

1121
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:29,182

Alright, drop it.

1122
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:30,651


1123
01:02:30,783 --> 01:02:32,885


1124
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:34,588
Who's the piece of shit now?

1125
01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:35,755


1126
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:37,524
They've taken Rob and Scarlett.

1127
01:02:37,658 --> 01:02:39,459
What the fuck we gonna do, B.?

1128
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,595
What the fuck can we do?

1129
01:02:41,729 --> 01:02:43,129
It's just us now.

1130
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:44,864


1131
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:48,434


1132
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:51,437
[trembles]

1133
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:53,072
(Rob)'Hey.'

1134
01:02:54,474 --> 01:02:56,075
Hey, come here.

1135
01:02:56,577 --> 01:02:59,078
You know, I've been thinking
when we get through this shit...

1136
01:03:01,014 --> 01:03:03,016
what do you say
we get married?

1137
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,088
Santiago was wrong.

1138
01:03:09,222 --> 01:03:11,592
There is some crazy still
left in you, isn't there?

1139
01:03:11,725 --> 01:03:13,293
Because I wanna marry you?

1140
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,196
'Cause you think we're gonna
get through this shit.

1141
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:23,202
Whatever happens, I got you.

1142
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,441

1143
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:41,487
Oh, shit.

1144
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:47,460

Lee-Roy and Nacho...

1145
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:50,063
Tom's muscle
and a right pair of cunts.

1146
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:30,738
You got any famous last words?

1147
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,138
Fuck you.

1148
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:35,509
I expected something better.

1149
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,713
Hey, hey, hey.

1150
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:41,515
- Don't be afraid.
- Tom wanted to be sure.

1151
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:43,851
- Don't be afraid.
- No, no, no.

1152
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:46,419
- You got this in the front.
- You're gonna be okay.

1153
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:47,487

1154
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:49,422
No!

1155
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:50,957
No, no!

1156
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,494

No! No, no.

1157
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:56,295
No!

1158
01:04:57,831 --> 01:05:01,401
You fuckers. You fuckers.

1159
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:05,539


1160
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,480
Say goodbye, bitch.

1161
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:17,584


1162
01:05:23,456 --> 01:05:26,426
They look kinda sweet.
Laying there like that.

1163
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,762
Fuck this.

1164
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:32,365
Leave the dogs... to do
the clean-up.

1165
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:35,501
- Let's get a beer, bro.
- Let's go.

1166
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:47,280
[inhales]

1167
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:03,963
[plane droning]

1168
01:06:09,302 --> 01:06:10,704


1169
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:20,279

1170
01:06:42,001 --> 01:06:43,770


1171
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:48,174
[wailing]

1172
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:04,691


1173
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:45,532

1174
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:21,635


1175
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:29,610


1176
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:44,791

1177
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,620
I never felt so empty
in all my life.

1178
01:09:13,754 --> 01:09:16,623
I couldn't feel pain.
I couldn't feel anything.

1179
01:09:16,757 --> 01:09:19,693
My one true love was gone,
just like that.

1180
01:09:24,631 --> 01:09:26,767
All I could do
was take what I could carry

1181
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,535
and get the fuck out.

1182
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:43,784

1183
01:09:52,592 --> 01:09:54,326


1184
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,867


1185
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,521
(Aunt Nellie)
What used to I say to you

1186
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,990
when you were close
to giving up a fight.

1187
01:10:26,593 --> 01:10:29,930
You've never backed down
from a fight in your life.

1188
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,834
This is Scarlett.

1189
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,436
Can we meet?

1190
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,345
Scarlett,
it's good to see you again.

1191
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,316
Though I wish it were under
different circumstances.

1192
01:10:50,449 --> 01:10:52,953
Rob was a good man.

1193
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:54,453
The best.

1194
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:55,889
That's why I came here
to make sure

1195
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:57,691
his legacy
doesn't die with him.

1196
01:11:01,327 --> 01:11:04,396
I only agreed to this meeting

1197
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:07,067
out of respect for Rob.

1198
01:11:07,466 --> 01:11:10,302
Well, I admire your spirit,
but, uh

1199
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:12,539
let's get fucking serious.

1200
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,911
You're nobody
with nothing to bargain with.

1201
01:11:18,377 --> 01:11:20,446
You're no skin off my back,
if you were to

1202
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,716
fuck off and die in a ditch.

1203
01:11:22,983 --> 01:11:25,752
But I like you so, uh

1204
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:27,654
I won't help you to do that.

1205
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:31,758
Victor...show Ms. Scarlett
the door.

1206
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:33,026
Oi.

1207
01:11:34,528 --> 01:11:35,862
Do you really think
I'm the kinda girl

1208
01:11:35,996 --> 01:11:37,764
who's gonna let this go, hmm?

1209
01:11:37,898 --> 01:11:39,566
Hmm? Alright.

1210
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:44,436
I will give you four
and a half minutes.

1211
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,674
I'm gonna take it back.

1212
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:50,342
The entire operation.

1213
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:55,682
And if I succeed I'll deliver
everything Rob promised you.

1214
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:57,517
If you succeed.

1215
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:06,993
Do you know what it takes to
survive as a woman in our world?

1216
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:09,529
It's not enough to be
as good as a man

1217
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,998
you have to be twice as smart.

1218
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:15,769
Twice as ruthless,
three times a lady

1219
01:12:15,902 --> 01:12:17,671
and ten times a bitch.

1220
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,473
No ifs, buts or maybes.

1221
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:25,946
You better fucking succeed,
or they will eat you alive.

1222
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:28,548
And, um...

1223
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,451
...from where I'm sitting
I don't think

1224
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:34,855
you've got what it takes.

1225
01:12:34,988 --> 01:12:38,592
So, I am sorry for your loss.

1226
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:42,629
But from now on I'll be dealing
with the other side.

1227
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:44,965
Hmm.

1228
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:49,035
Don't suppose I can convince
you otherwise.

1229
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:54,107
I listened, that's as good as
you're gonna get from me.

1230
01:12:55,609 --> 01:12:56,743
Okay.

1231
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:00,547
- Whoa.
- How about now?

1232
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:03,482
Pick pocket, bitch.

1233
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:05,619
Anybody move, I'll blow
her fucking brains out.

1234
01:13:06,586 --> 01:13:08,154
I told you I liked you

1235
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:11,423
but you really are trying
my patience.

1236
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,994
Desperate fucking times,
desperate fucking measures.

1237
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:20,166
Do you know how many people have
drawn a gun on me and lived?

1238
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,002
Not too many, I should think.

1239
01:13:22,135 --> 01:13:25,404
Zero. Point zero.

1240
01:13:36,549 --> 01:13:38,051
They killed every part of me.

1241
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:41,721
Left me with nothing

1242
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:43,455
but skin and bone.

1243
01:13:44,391 --> 01:13:47,160
Then you should be very grateful
they left you that

1244
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,195
and get out while you can.

1245
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,899
If you had the choice again,
would you?

1246
01:13:55,368 --> 01:13:56,803
Mm.

1247
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:58,905
Then you know
I have to see this through.

1248
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:01,875
Two weeks.

1249
01:14:02,008 --> 01:14:04,010
Either it's done,
or I'm dead in a ditch.

1250
01:14:09,249 --> 01:14:10,817
Or kill me now
and be done with it.

1251
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,654
That's how you're going
to beat 'em.

1252
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,458
When I was little,
my grandmother used to

1253
01:14:19,592 --> 01:14:22,494
tell me stories about a woman
from her hometown

1254
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,564
they called Lady Death.

1255
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,733
This was in the Ukraine.

1256
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:30,502
Her real name was
Lyudmila Pavlichenko.

1257
01:14:31,371 --> 01:14:33,340
She would have been about your

1258
01:14:33,472 --> 01:14:34,708
age when she joined the army

1259
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:38,678
to fight the Nazis attacking
Sevastopol in 1941

1260
01:14:39,045 --> 01:14:43,616
and her particular skill was
with a rifle, a long-range, and

1261
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,386

she was so fucking

1262
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:47,787
good at it.

1263
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:52,491
She eventually chalked up
309 confirmed deaths.

1264
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:57,063
That's more than any of the men
did in her unit.

1265
01:14:57,197 --> 01:14:59,632
I mean, she became
a national hero.

1266
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,603
And she was as tireless
and fearless

1267
01:15:03,737 --> 01:15:08,775
and ruthless a bitch, as you
could ever care to meet.

1268
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:14,147
And I think, that you two
would have got along.

1269
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:18,385
Come on. Skedaddle.

1270
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:21,721
Go kill 'em all
and when you're done, call me.

1271
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:26,292
As long as you're still alive,
the deal stands.

1272
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:37,604


1273
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:45,578


1274
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:12,639


1275
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:22,082
- Hey. Stop, stop, stop.
- Hey.

1276
01:16:22,215 --> 01:16:23,883
- It's me.
- Let go, Danny.

1277
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:25,618


1278
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,221
So you can slot him
in the street.

1279
01:16:28,354 --> 01:16:29,557
It's a big fucking plan, is it?

1280
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,690
- I just want him dead.
- Yeah, well.

1281
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:33,159
You know, well, so do I.

1282
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:36,329
But you can't get emotional
about this kinda shit.

1283
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:38,832
You gotta remain detached.

1284
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:44,270
This is what I do, so let me
fucking help you.

1285
01:16:46,906 --> 01:16:49,042
What about Baraka?

1286
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:52,078
- Did he make it?
- We split up. It's safer.

1287
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:55,583
Well, if he's smart I think
he'll be long gone.

1288
01:16:55,715 --> 01:16:58,718
- That means it's just us then.
- Yeah.

1289
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:01,688
You in?

1290
01:17:04,592 --> 01:17:06,292
Yeah.

1291
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,135

Are you gonna come in?

1292
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:17,538
Or you gonna stand there
and drool.

1293
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,239
You got a mouth on you.

1294
01:17:19,372 --> 01:17:20,940
What else is it good for?

1295
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:22,976

1296
01:17:26,446 --> 01:17:27,780


1297
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:30,350


1298
01:17:35,722 --> 01:17:36,890

You won't kill me.

1305
01:17:53,072 --> 01:17:54,807
You don't have the balls, bitch.

1306
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:57,076
What have balls got
to do with it?

1307
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,179

1311
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,254
Oh, fucking hell.

1312
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,459
Get in the fucking car, Duchess.

1313
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:17,163


1314
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,603
Where the fuck
did you come from?

1315
01:18:22,735 --> 01:18:24,437
I've been staking out this place
for a week.

1316
01:18:24,572 --> 01:18:28,107
Imagine my surprise seeing a
dead woman walk out the door.

1317
01:18:28,274 --> 01:18:29,742
Good to see you too.

1318
01:18:29,876 --> 01:18:32,513
Danny, keeping out of trouble,
I see.

1319
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:35,882
Then explain to me what
the hell you were thinking?

1320
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:37,518
Who knew he'd fall out
the fucking window

1321
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:38,751
things didn't go to plan?

1322
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:40,753
Things rarely do.

1323
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:44,558
Instead of bitching about it,
why don't you help us out?

1324
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:46,226
What is she talking about?

1325
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:48,728
I'm talking about
taking back the kingdom, Baraka.

1326
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:50,531
I'm gonna kill every last
fucker that betrayed Rob

1327
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:51,864
and I'm just getting started.

1328
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:54,702
You put her up to this,
didn't you?

1329
01:18:54,834 --> 01:18:56,637
Are you fucking
out of your mind?

1330
01:18:56,769 --> 01:18:58,771
I've never been so clear
about anything in all my life.

1331
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:00,807
What happened to you?

1332
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,610
I've nothing else left to lose.

1333
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:04,077
How about your life?

1334
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,045
They can't kill me,
I'm already dead.

1335
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,517
Do you have any idea
what you're up against?

1336
01:19:10,651 --> 01:19:12,485
I don't care.

1337
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:16,189
Oh, come on, B.

1338
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:18,758
Won't be a party without you,
mate.

1339
01:19:18,891 --> 01:19:21,194
You're as crazy as she is.

1340
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:22,630
If I help...

1341
01:19:22,762 --> 01:19:24,897
it's just this once,
then I am done.

1342
01:19:25,331 --> 01:19:26,700
Once is all we need.

1343
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:29,402
Just so you understand, Duchess,
what're you're asking

1344
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:31,337
is a blood oath.

1345
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:33,973
We do this,
or we die trying.

1346
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:40,947
With Danny out of action,
we'll need an extra hand.

1347
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,016
That's very fucking funny, mate.

1348
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:45,018
Do you know anyone we can trust?

1349
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:47,521
Family.

1350
01:19:48,154 --> 01:19:50,390
But first we need to get you
off the street.

1351
01:19:51,324 --> 01:19:52,492
I know a place.

1352
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:56,029
We couldn't go
via the hospital, could we?

1353
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:02,536

Dios mio!

1357
01:20:13,346 --> 01:20:15,448
Duchess, you're alive?

1358
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:18,117
It's a nice place you got here.

1359
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,853
It's cozy.

1360
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,122
It needs some work, but...

1361
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:26,092
But what are you doing here?

1362
01:20:28,461 --> 01:20:31,197
I need your help.

1363
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:35,301
I can't offer much besides, a
cold beer and a place to hide.

1364
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:37,970
But I will never forget
what you did for me, Duchess.

1365
01:20:39,573 --> 01:20:40,873
My place is yours.

1366
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:42,942

'Whoever it was, they'

Fucking Rob's pitbull Baraka
avenging his master's death.

1370
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:55,388
Do you think we should
warn the others?

1371
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:01,894
Not yet.

1372
01:21:03,797 --> 01:21:05,865
Maybe there is a play
to be made here.

1373
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:14,541
Like Victor said, it pays
to keep your family close.

1374
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:18,478
This is Jono, Baraka's nephew
and our first recruit.

1375
01:21:19,145 --> 01:21:21,881
- To our friend.
- To Rob.

- Good to see you too.

- Danny.
- Danny.

1382
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:41,769
- Alright.
- Nice to meet you.

1383
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:44,671
- Nice to meet you.
- So...

1384
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:46,939
What are we doing
in this shit hole?

1385
01:21:47,073 --> 01:21:48,941
This is my place, asshole.

1386
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:52,278
If you don't like it,
you can stick it up your ass.

1387
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:55,481
That is Maria
and she is with us.

1388
01:21:56,817 --> 01:21:57,885
Sorry.

1389
01:21:58,484 --> 01:22:01,655
So you deal dope,
we deal diamonds.

01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:04,390
That's Fredo,
a right slippery customer.

1391
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:06,959
Rob never fucked
with your business...

1392
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:09,162
...and you never
fucked with his.

1393

Everything was, uh...cushty.

1394
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:17,437
So why are you now sticking your
beak in where it doesn't belong?

Shit, girl, I dunno
what you're talking about.

You want to play
in a man's world

1401
01:22:32,318 --> 01:22:34,987
you better be ready to get
fucked in the ass.

1402
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:38,391
We all get fucked in the ass
sooner or later.

1403
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:39,693
That's the world we live in.

1404
01:22:40,092 --> 01:22:43,062
Man or woman, we all
look the same from behind.

1405
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:46,265
Why don't you just tell me
where he is.

1406
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,735
Be a lot easier that way.

1407
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:51,404
I already told you,
I don't know shit.

Call it female intuition, but...

I think you're telling me
porky pies.

Now, what is a pork and--

1411

Tell me where he is,
you fucking slag

or I'll skewer something else
to the table.

1413
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:06,118
- Where is he?
- Alright. Alright.

1414
01:23:06,252 --> 01:23:09,021
I don't know where he is,
but I know someone who does.

1415
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:11,290
His name is Riff. Riff.

1416

No.

1421
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:24,170
- You hadn't told him.
- Nope.

1422
01:23:25,639 --> 01:23:27,206
Well, mate, she's like...

1423

...she's like a fucking banshee.

Yeah, she wears this like,
massive tribal necklace

with all the balls

1427
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:41,487
of the men that she's killed.

1428
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:43,724
Yep.

1429
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:46,158
That's our Duchess.

1430
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:50,697
So you better be careful with
that loud mouth of yours or...

Hey...

Here. Duchess never forgets
a friend.

Did Baraka tell you
what you're getting into?

1447

- He did.
- And you still came anyway.

I ain't afraid of trouble.

1449

Not if it's for family.

1450

But I ain't your family.

a daughter to him.

01:24:55,862 --> 01:24:57,731
That makes us cousins.

1453
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:01,635
- I have only one question.
- What's that?

1454
01:25:02,569 --> 01:25:05,939
How the fuck we gonna take down
the entire organizations

1455
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:08,609
with two guys, two girls
and one armed bandit?

1456
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:10,844
- Careful.
- No offense.

1457
01:25:12,178 --> 01:25:13,647
Good question.

1458
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:18,952
Look, if we go head to head
with these fuckers

1459
01:25:19,086 --> 01:25:20,787
we'll get creamed.

1460
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:23,222
So we have to outsmart them.

1461
01:25:23,356 --> 01:25:25,859
Hit them, one by one.

1462
01:25:26,026 --> 01:25:28,194
and maybe if I live long enough

1463
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,364
I'll get to use Tom's balls
as earrings.

1464
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:33,634
I thought it was a necklace.

1465
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:36,603


1466
01:25:36,737 --> 01:25:38,805
For you I'll make it into
fucking cufflinks.

1467
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:40,473
How about that?

1468
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:42,576
Alright.

1469
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:43,744
Yeah, but what we're really

1470
01:25:43,877 --> 01:25:45,779
gonna need is more men.

1471
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,115
And big fucking guns.

1472
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:50,182
Men and guns don't come cheap.

1473
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:52,519
At least not the ones
worth having.

1474
01:25:54,888 --> 01:25:57,090
Holy fucking shit.

1475
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:01,094
When the time comes we'll have
all the men and guns we need.

1476
01:26:01,394 --> 01:26:03,964
But a move like that,
draws too much attention.

1477
01:26:04,363 --> 01:26:06,667
As long as they think I'm dead,
we have an advantage.

1478
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,434
Let's use it.

1479
01:26:09,335 --> 01:26:10,704
What did you have in mind?

1480
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,408
When I was learning how to
pick pockets, I would study

1481
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:17,243
how street magicians
would draw your attention

1482
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,211
away from
what's really going on.

1483
01:26:19,345 --> 01:26:20,981
They're too busy
looking at your tits

1484
01:26:21,114 --> 01:26:22,783
they ain't seen your hand
lift their wallet.

1485
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:25,952
We apply a little misdirection

1486
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:27,654
the fuckers won't see us coming.

1487
01:26:29,756 --> 01:26:30,957
Ain't that right, Michelle?

1488
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:35,394
Easy boys, she's with me.

1489
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:40,332
- Glad you could make it.
- Glad you asked.

1490
01:26:40,466 --> 01:26:42,468
Everyone this is my mate,
Michelle.

1491
01:26:43,904 --> 01:26:45,404
Hi, Michelle.

1492
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,975
- Welcome to the nuthouse.
- The nuthouse?

1493
01:26:49,241 --> 01:26:52,612
Yeah. You have to be crazy
to be here.

1494
01:26:52,746 --> 01:26:54,047
Alright.

1495
01:26:54,581 --> 01:26:57,050
Baraka, we need to make
a house call.

1496
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:58,852
Who's the target?

1497
01:26:58,985 --> 01:27:01,287


1498
01:27:03,523 --> 01:27:06,225
Riff, low level gun for hire.

1499
01:27:06,358 --> 01:27:07,861
Been known to do
the odd job for Tom.

1500
01:27:07,994 --> 01:27:09,029
Fuck.

1501
01:27:09,162 --> 01:27:10,697


1502
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:13,834

1503
01:27:13,967 --> 01:27:15,602
What the hell you were thinking,
man?

1504
01:27:17,403 --> 01:27:20,707
I dunno, it's a reflex
action, is that.

1505
01:27:22,142 --> 01:27:24,177
Ninja and shit.

1506
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,245
- Okay.
- Ow.

1507
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:34,487
Oh, fuck. Fuck you.

1508
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:37,323
I already told you, I dunno
where the fuck he's at.

1509
01:27:39,826 --> 01:27:41,194


1510
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,630

Fuck you. Get me out.

1511
01:27:44,263 --> 01:27:46,166
But the trouble is, Riff,

1512
01:27:46,298 --> 01:27:48,935
you're a lying piece of shit.

1513
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:51,671
Oh, stop. Fuck.

1514
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:53,940


1515
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:56,576
I'm nothin', okay.

1516
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,310
They don't give me the time
of the fucking day

1517
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:00,013
I can't tell you
what I don't know, right?

1518
01:28:00,379 --> 01:28:02,883
Is that how you wanna play?

1519
01:28:03,884 --> 01:28:04,985

1520
01:28:05,519 --> 01:28:06,820
Okay.

1521
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,556
He's all yours, Duchess.

1522
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:13,560

'What the fuck.'

1523
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:17,864
Wait.

1524
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:19,132
Wait, wait, wait.

1525
01:28:19,266 --> 01:28:21,201
Where you going? Wait, wait.

1526
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:22,936
Stop, stop, stop it.

1527
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:27,941
Wait, wait.

1528
01:28:31,878 --> 01:28:33,547
Well?

1529
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,848
Well, what?

1530
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:38,118
Fuck.

1531
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,954
No more piss-assing about, Riff.

1532
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:42,722
(Baraka)
'I'm worried about her.'

1533
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:47,828
Since she came back,
she's changed.

1534
01:28:48,862 --> 01:28:52,065
Something definitely got
fucking broken out there.

1535
01:28:54,366 --> 01:28:55,869
Can't be fixed.

1536
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:59,739
The quicker you speak,
the quicker the pain stops.

1537
01:28:59,873 --> 01:29:03,043
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
What're you doing?

1538
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:05,212
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.

1539
01:29:05,344 --> 01:29:07,479


1540
01:29:14,054 --> 01:29:15,222
Where is Lee-Roy?

1541
01:29:15,354 --> 01:29:17,023


1542
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:21,228
I don't know.
He's hiding in his chop shop.

1543
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,898
He's hiding in his chop shop
by the airport. Stop.

1544
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:27,067
[crying]

1545
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:32,038

[coughs]

1547
01:29:42,115 --> 01:29:43,116
Hey.

1548
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,051


1549
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:50,690
I ever see you again...I come
back to finish the job.

1550
01:29:51,992 --> 01:29:53,593


1551
01:29:55,862 --> 01:29:57,130
Cool off.

1552
01:29:57,264 --> 01:29:58,598

1553
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:02,102
Fuck.

1554
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:05,471
Any chance we could, uh...

1555
01:30:06,606 --> 01:30:08,008
...pop by the hospital?

1556
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:11,544
[plane droning]

1557

(Jono)
'Two out front, well armed.'

1558
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,119
'No sign of Lee-Roy.'

1559
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:20,654
Copy that.

1560
01:30:21,388 --> 01:30:22,656
He's in there.

1561
01:30:23,556 --> 01:30:25,424
If you ask me, Duchess,
and you haven't,

1562
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:28,595
this is a trap
and Lee-Roy is the bait.

1563
01:30:28,728 --> 01:30:30,096
Don't care. I'm going in anyway.

1564
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,531
And I go where she goes, mate.

1565
01:30:31,665 --> 01:30:33,465
Quit encouraging her.

1566
01:30:34,466 --> 01:30:35,802
You want to live forever?

1567
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:37,137
Nope.

1568
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:39,673
You know, I wouldn't mind.

1569
01:30:44,177 --> 01:30:45,612
Okay, Jono, you're up.

1570
01:30:47,247 --> 01:30:49,149


1571
01:30:57,657 --> 01:31:01,261
- Stay the fuck back.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1572
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:04,331
Take it easy guys.
Take it easy, take it easy.

1573
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:06,700
I come in peace as you can see.

1574
01:31:08,101 --> 01:31:12,005
I brought you some
tasty chicken calientes.

1575
01:31:12,272 --> 01:31:15,342

Take a good look.

1576
01:31:15,474 --> 01:31:17,110
Gorgeous, right?

1577
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:20,613


1578
01:31:22,615 --> 01:31:24,784


1579
01:31:26,152 --> 01:31:27,687
Fuck.

1580
01:31:29,356 --> 01:31:31,391
- Can't open the gate.
- Fuck it.

1581
01:31:31,524 --> 01:31:32,926
Let's get this party started.

1582
01:31:33,059 --> 01:31:34,594
Click fucking clack.

01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:38,531


1584
01:31:41,868 --> 01:31:44,270
Get to the back-up car
and keep the engine running.

1585
01:31:44,404 --> 01:31:45,905
I got this.

1592
01:32:15,735 --> 01:32:16,903
Go.

01:32:22,575 --> 01:32:24,310


1595
01:32:33,787 --> 01:32:36,656
It's Lee-Roy.
I'm going after him.

1596
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,191
Duchess, watch out.

1597
01:32:39,325 --> 01:32:40,660


1598
01:32:43,531 --> 01:32:45,598
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
- Shit.

1599
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,667
You've got company.
Get out of there.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1613

1622
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:18,952
I was just following orders.

1623
01:35:19,085 --> 01:35:20,654
And now you're gonna die for it.

1624
01:35:20,787 --> 01:35:22,355
Please, Scarlett.

1625
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:25,225

my name's Duchess.

Oh, fuck.

1632
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:10,870
- Yeah.
- 'Welcome back from the grave.'

1633
01:36:11,004 --> 01:36:13,172
I never talked
to a corpse before.

1634
01:36:13,306 --> 01:36:15,808
- Me neither.
- We have your friends.

1635
01:36:15,942 --> 01:36:18,177
But I'm prepared
to offer you a deal.

1636

Their lives for yours.

1637
01:36:21,749 --> 01:36:24,450
Alright. I'm in.

1638
01:36:33,761 --> 01:36:35,795

1639
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:45,805
You still with us, Scarlett?

1640
01:36:46,839 --> 01:36:48,542

1641
01:36:58,752 --> 01:37:01,054
That's right. Stare daggers.

1642
01:37:01,954 --> 01:37:05,158
I know how much
you'd like to kill me right now.

1643
01:37:06,225 --> 01:37:09,862
And if I were in your shoes
I'd feel the same way.

1644
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:13,833


1645
01:37:13,966 --> 01:37:15,636
What the fuck is so funny?

1646
01:37:15,803 --> 01:37:17,538
I'm just trying to picture you
wear my shoes.

1647
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:20,873

1648
01:37:21,007 --> 01:37:22,041

It looks bad I know.

1649
01:37:22,175 --> 01:37:23,510
Baraka was right, things rarely

1650
01:37:23,644 --> 01:37:24,712
do turn out the way you plan,

1651
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:26,312
but stay with me on this.

1652
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:29,248

1653
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:34,588
Don't make me do that again.

1654
01:37:34,854 --> 01:37:37,924

Go and piss up a rope.

1655
01:37:38,057 --> 01:37:39,859
You know, you've been
pretty busy

1656
01:37:40,828 --> 01:37:43,863
since your little resurrection.

1657
01:37:43,996 --> 01:37:46,265
But after you killed Nacho,
it didn't take a fucking genius

1658
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:48,868
to figure out
you'd come after Lee-Roy next.

1659
01:37:49,001 --> 01:37:51,237
Still two for two.

1660
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:52,872
- I'm impressed.
- Aw.

1661
01:37:53,005 --> 01:37:55,308
You're easily impressed,
ain't you?

1662
01:37:55,509 --> 01:37:57,977

1663
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:02,415
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

1664
01:38:03,349 --> 01:38:04,618


1665
01:38:05,418 --> 01:38:06,754
You know what, Scarlett?

1666
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:10,524
I just, I just gotta make sure

1667
01:38:11,057 --> 01:38:13,560
that Rob doesn't come through
that fucking door.

1668
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:16,028
Didn't you hear?

1669
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:18,632
He's dead.

1670
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:21,267
Like you?

1671
01:38:23,503 --> 01:38:25,071
Bring them out here.

1672
01:38:30,677 --> 01:38:33,680
Wait, I thought we had a deal.
You gave me your word.

1673
01:38:33,814 --> 01:38:35,448


1674
01:38:36,717 --> 01:38:38,519
You think I'm a man of my word?

1675
01:38:42,523 --> 01:38:44,090
No. Danny.

1676
01:38:45,358 --> 01:38:47,493
I'm alright.

1677
01:38:47,628 --> 01:38:49,495
Oh, you fucker.

1678
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:53,232
Go on and take your fucking
septic cuts.

1679
01:38:55,168 --> 01:38:56,637
He's dead, alright.

1680
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:58,739
Well, unfortunately

1681
01:38:58,872 --> 01:39:02,074
your being here,
is proof to the contrary.

1682
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:04,977
Sorry, Danny boy.

1683
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:07,046Motherfucker!

1684
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,414


1685
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:13,152
Fuck you!

1686
01:39:13,286 --> 01:39:16,022
- Fucking dead!
- Alright.

1687
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,960
Fuck.

1688
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:25,431
Ahh!

1689
01:39:25,566 --> 01:39:29,001
You know it's no fun,
when they don't scream anymore.

1690
01:39:29,536 --> 01:39:31,504
I guess we're gonna have
to try something else.

1691
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:38,512
I'm gonna enjoy
the hell out of this.

1692
01:39:38,645 --> 01:39:40,246
[drill machine whizzing]

1693
01:39:42,014 --> 01:39:43,517
Fuck you.

1694
01:39:44,518 --> 01:39:48,154
And when I'm done
lobotomizing Baraka...

1695
01:39:49,857 --> 01:39:51,424
the girls are next.

1696
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:56,429
Jesus Christ! He's dead,
he's fucking dead, alright!

1697
01:39:57,497 --> 01:39:58,665


1698
01:40:06,072 --> 01:40:07,708
You know what?

1699
01:40:08,642 --> 01:40:09,943
I believe you.

1700
01:40:10,844 --> 01:40:16,215
I think...I'm gonna be able to
sleep a little easier tonight.

1701
01:40:19,653 --> 01:40:20,854
You know...

1702
01:40:21,287 --> 01:40:23,456
I know why
you really killed Rob.

1703
01:40:24,156 --> 01:40:26,593
And it wasn't just about
the business.

1704
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:28,194
Oh, yeah?

1705
01:40:31,565 --> 01:40:33,099

1706
01:40:34,066 --> 01:40:35,536
Enlighten me.

1707
01:40:36,637 --> 01:40:38,070
Rob had everything.

1708
01:40:39,305 --> 01:40:41,808
Not just the power...

1709
01:40:41,942 --> 01:40:44,711
...the looks, the charm...

1710
01:40:46,813 --> 01:40:50,249
...the style. What have you got?

1711
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:54,453
[cracks neck]

1712
01:41:00,326 --> 01:41:02,696
You got some balls on you,
princess.

1713
01:41:02,829 --> 01:41:05,699
No, I don't, that's the point.

1714
01:41:05,999 --> 01:41:08,067
And it's Duchess, dickhead.

1715
01:41:12,973 --> 01:41:14,508

1716
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:19,646


1717
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:22,616
Hey, Johannes.

1718
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:24,083
What if I give you
a million dollars

1719
01:41:24,216 --> 01:41:25,619
to shoot him in the head
right now?

1720
01:41:26,954 --> 01:41:29,656
Oh, is, is that your big plan?

1721
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:31,257
To turn us against each other?

1722
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:33,359
No, you already did that.

1723
01:41:33,492 --> 01:41:35,461
You killed Rob and his brother.

1724
01:41:36,362 --> 01:41:38,197
Johannes, you think
a man like this

1725
01:41:38,331 --> 01:41:39,733
is willing to share the power?

1726
01:41:40,433 --> 01:41:42,736
Won't be long before it's your
neck on the chopping block.

1727
01:41:46,673 --> 01:41:49,175
- Don't even think about it.
- Think about what?

1728
01:41:50,309 --> 01:41:53,580
Is she right, bru? You're
planning on killing me too?

1729
01:41:57,450 --> 01:41:59,753
Don't you see
she's fucking with you?

1730
01:41:59,886 --> 01:42:02,488
- Am I?
- Maybe I kill you first, huh?

1731
01:42:02,623 --> 01:42:04,825
Boys, boys, boys.

1732
01:42:06,093 --> 01:42:09,228
Don't you think
if my plan to go after Lee-Roy

1733
01:42:09,362 --> 01:42:11,665
was pretty fucking obvious
to you two

1734
01:42:12,532 --> 01:42:15,902
maybe it was pretty
fucking obvious to me too?

1735
01:42:16,036 --> 01:42:17,604
What?

1736
01:42:21,108 --> 01:42:23,910
[dramatic music]

1737
01:42:29,082 --> 01:42:30,851


1738
01:42:32,151 --> 01:42:33,720


1739
01:42:35,822 --> 01:42:37,456
Rob once told me...

1740
01:42:38,959 --> 01:42:41,628
...that power, real power...

1741
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:46,600
...can never be given,
it has to be taken.

1742
01:42:46,833 --> 01:42:48,234


1743
01:42:50,202 --> 01:42:52,471
Look around, that's what
I'm doing, you stupid bitch.

1744
01:42:52,739 --> 01:42:55,909
No, no. That's what you think
you're doing.

1745
01:42:56,475 --> 01:42:58,078
Fuck you,
I don't have time for this.

1746
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,846
[explosion]

1747
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,548
Men with big fucking guns,
remember?

1748
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,850
Turns out, diamonds are
a girls best friend.

1749
01:43:03,984 --> 01:43:05,052


1750
01:43:05,184 --> 01:43:06,887


1751
01:43:08,522 --> 01:43:10,590


1752
01:43:18,765 --> 01:43:21,300
No. No.

1753
01:43:21,467 --> 01:43:23,202
[drill machine whizzing]

1754
01:43:24,604 --> 01:43:26,673
[dramatic music]

1755
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:29,643


1756
01:43:42,055 --> 01:43:43,523
Duchess.

1757
01:43:44,024 --> 01:43:45,659
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1758
01:43:47,527 --> 01:43:48,962


1759
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:51,363
Drop it, sunshine.

1760
01:43:51,497 --> 01:43:53,667
- Stay back.
- Show me your hands.

1761
01:43:54,634 --> 01:43:56,002
He's mine.

1762
01:44:01,942 --> 01:44:04,410
You wanna show me
how big your balls really are?

1763
01:44:06,747 --> 01:44:08,014
Come to daddy.

1764
01:44:09,381 --> 01:44:12,418


1765
01:44:18,558 --> 01:44:19,693


1766
01:44:21,695 --> 01:44:23,429


1767
01:44:34,207 --> 01:44:35,575


1768
01:44:38,145 --> 01:44:39,846
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1769
01:44:44,584 --> 01:44:46,485
This is where your story ends...

1770
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:48,855
Princess.

1771
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:51,825
Do your worst.

1772
01:44:54,661 --> 01:44:55,996

1773
01:44:57,998 --> 01:44:59,599


1774
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:06,039


1775
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:13,445
Scarlett, please.

1776
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,182
It wasn't personal.

1777
01:45:15,314 --> 01:45:17,818
Don't. You butchered Rob.

1778
01:45:18,484 --> 01:45:19,953
Doesn't get more personal.

1779
01:45:20,554 --> 01:45:22,088
But if it makes you feel better.

1780
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:24,423
It was a pleasure doing
business.

1781
01:45:24,991 --> 01:45:26,827


1782
01:45:26,993 --> 01:45:28,094


1783
01:45:28,228 --> 01:45:29,930


1784
01:45:34,234 --> 01:45:36,002
Oh, fuck.

1785
01:45:36,136 --> 01:45:37,237

1786
01:45:37,369 --> 01:45:39,673
I think we did enough for today.

1787
01:45:39,806 --> 01:45:41,508
Fuck, yeah.

1788
01:45:44,144 --> 01:45:45,946
You took your precious
fucking time.

1789
01:45:46,146 --> 01:45:47,379
I was running out of bullshit.

1790
01:45:47,514 --> 01:45:49,015
I find that fucking hard
to believe.

1791
01:45:49,149 --> 01:45:50,550
Oi, watch it, dipstick.

1792
01:45:50,684 --> 01:45:52,384
Oh, that's gratitude for you.

1793
01:45:52,519 --> 01:45:54,988
Come on, boys.
Get your shit together.

1794
01:46:00,459 --> 01:46:02,028
How you doing, Duchess?

1795
01:46:02,162 --> 01:46:04,798
We did it. We fucking did it.

1796
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:08,467
No. You did it.

1797
01:46:21,514 --> 01:46:24,517

1798
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:30,891
I made it through,
by the skin of my teeth.

1799
01:46:31,024 --> 01:46:34,127
And there I was with my own
fucked up little family.

1800
01:46:34,261 --> 01:46:36,329
It should have been perfect

1801
01:46:36,462 --> 01:46:39,099
but there would always
be one thing missing.

1802
01:46:40,533 --> 01:46:42,002
You alright, guys?

1803
01:46:46,573 --> 01:46:49,242
Here, fill your boots.

1804
01:46:49,376 --> 01:46:50,810
You're not shitting me,
are you?

1805
01:46:53,813 --> 01:46:55,015
You've earned it.

1806
01:46:58,385 --> 01:47:00,921
- How's your arm, Danny?
- Tickety-boo.

1807
01:47:02,454 --> 01:47:04,824
Duchess... it's Charlie.

1808
01:47:07,227 --> 01:47:08,528
Charlie.

1809
01:47:08,662 --> 01:47:10,897
'Somehow, I knew
you'd pull it off.'

1810
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:15,001
Your first shipment
arrives on Friday.

1811
01:47:15,135 --> 01:47:16,468
I expect payment on delivery.

1812
01:47:16,603 --> 01:47:18,371
What kind of a cunt
do you think I am?

1813
01:47:18,504 --> 01:47:19,873
'Paying kind, of course.'

1814
01:47:20,472 --> 01:47:23,677
I think you and I could do great
things together.

1815
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:25,912
Maybe...

1816
01:47:26,046 --> 01:47:27,814
In another life, but, uh...

1817
01:47:29,382 --> 01:47:31,318
I've come to the end of the line
right now.

1818
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,053
Baraka will be taking over
from now on.

1819
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,621


1820
01:47:35,322 --> 01:47:37,290
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1821
01:47:37,424 --> 01:47:38,858
Ciao, Charlie.

1822
01:47:42,529 --> 01:47:45,031
Did that bitch
just hang up on me?

1823
01:47:48,234 --> 01:47:50,537
Duchess...

1824
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,739
I did what I set out to do,
Baraka.

1825
01:47:53,239 --> 01:47:54,708
And now I'm done.

1826
01:47:56,376 --> 01:47:58,044
Look after them for me.

1827
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,481

1828
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:16,763
So here I am, I've come
a long way in a short time.

1829
01:48:20,867 --> 01:48:23,470
At the end of the day,
I am what I am.

1830
01:48:23,803 --> 01:48:27,440
I talk dirty, I hit hard,
I drink my vodka straight.

1831
01:48:27,741 --> 01:48:29,776
And I don't take shit
from anyone.

1832
01:48:31,745 --> 01:48:34,214
I've loved, I've lost.

1833
01:48:34,414 --> 01:48:37,050
I've taken power
and I've earned my respect.

1834
01:48:37,984 --> 01:48:41,021
Revenge may be a dish
best served cold

1835
01:48:41,154 --> 01:48:42,989
but it taste bitter sweet.

1836
01:48:43,123 --> 01:48:46,559
I did what I had to do
and now I choose to walk away.

1837
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:48,862
Because that's what Rob
would have wanted.

1838
01:48:48,995 --> 01:48:50,897


1839
01:48:54,467 --> 01:48:57,037

1840
01:49:06,146 --> 01:49:07,547
Riff.

1841
01:49:08,516 --> 01:49:09,983
[explosion]

1842
01:49:16,556 --> 01:49:19,325
Hold your horses,
did I say you could leave yet?

1843

[rewind]

1844
01:49:23,329 --> 01:49:25,265

1846
01:49:39,245 --> 01:49:42,315

1847
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:51,057
My name is Duchess
and I live by one simple rule.

1848
01:49:51,724 --> 01:49:53,793
Never let 'em see me coming.

1849
01:49:53,927 --> 01:49:55,061
